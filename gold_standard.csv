1017383_T,1,"{65,66,68}","Thanks for the question. First I want to make clear, acquisitions in the software data management business for metabolic testing is not something that we are looking at at this time. We are looking for to bring in products and/or acquire companies in more of the device side of the business. I wanted to clarify that but the growth for us in the software data management business will be internal growth. With that maybe I will pass it over to Ken to discuss what the feelings are at the states. Eric, a good question. The legislative aspects of it really don't come into play quite as much as you might think because all of states are currently testing for some level of newborn metabolic at this time. There isn't necessarily a legislative leverage that is needed to make a state test babies, they are already doing some level of testing. The key question is when are they going to implement increased testing, so moving from 4, 5, 6, 7 tests up to the 25, 35, 45 testing levels. And there is a big push -- I don't have the article right in from of me but there's a big push among several groups and more recently they are really pushing for a consistent approach across all states so that being born in Virginia is no different than being born in New York. That approach really is doesn't require a legislative mandate in each state; what it requires is the state and usually the governor to adopt the technology called Tandem Math Spectrometry, and a lot of the states already have the machine, they have been buying them over the last several years. 
 The key question is how are they going to implement this technology? Do they have the current setup at the lab, state labs? Do they have the software necessary to track the babies once they are unidentified for these exponential number of tests. That is where we see the opportunity. We have implemented recently in New York; the New York program runs on Neometrics software, it is the largest and most comprehensive program in the country at this point in time, they test for almost 40 maladies right now. I think they're going to expand to 45 some time throughout this year towards midyear. That process took two or three years to get them to evolve to the point where they wanted to expand it. 
 They selected our software to help them expand the capabilities of the lab testing that they had in place, we've implemented that and we continue to work with them. We also had implemented something for the National Center for Genetic Research which correlates all the data from all the states for the CDC. Neometrics' product line was selected to implement that at the University of Texas. So we have the data aggregation at the end of the train if you will for the CDC. We've done smaller states and now the biggest state program in the country at New York. We really think our product offering, our suite of software products fits very well into this expansion of the current paradigm. So really they take these new devices, the Tandem Mass Spectrometry devices and implement them at the state lab level to test for more maladies with a process that is already in place at the hospital, already in place at the lab, so they have to change some procedures and some things that really the question is what do you do with these results and how do you handle them? How do you make sure kids don't fall through the safety net once they are identified? 
 And we think we are well-positioned for that, and again as Jim said, its very lumpy because states don't do these things in lockstep. And we aren't the driver of the implementation, the states are. They give us the order and they want an implementation that might take 6 to 9 months to implement and fully get them up and running. We see a large order and then an implementation period and then we got to deal with several states at the same time. But I can tell you that the activity level is high, that we are in talking to states about implementing their programs, doing the Tandem Mass Spectrometry implementation at the time.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

We are seeing a number of new accounts that we won during the quarter. And so the deals greater than $50,000 was the largest that it has been. What we see is that customers typically adopt a couple of pilots. They convert a single business process. And once they have success in that and demonstrate the ROI within the company, they then go ahead and make repeat purchases. And so our business was also characterized by both new business, as well as repeat business. In terms of the average price, that is going to fluctuate. It is influenced by the larger deals that we have in the quarter. But overall, we are pleased with the amount of adoption we are seeing of our customers solutions. Sasa, I really think it is important to think of this as a multiple-year opportunity. The fact that last quarter, 39 customers spent at least $50,000 on the license software and probably somewhere around an additional 250,000 or more to deploy the solution; and that this quarter, that number went up to 60, gives us cause for a great deal of encouragement.

We’ve seen some actual price increases on a customer-by-customer basis. But we’ve also seen sheet count reductions where we’re following. 
 There is another sheet count reduction, which is in play now, a fairly large sheet count reduction in premium and ultra bath tissue, which is a large category for us. And in one case it caused us to defer the prior sheet count reduction with one large customer and instead, put both of them in at the same time.

 We elected, with one customer, not to reduce the sheet counts because, from an earlier -- we had a longer negotiation with that customer and by the time we got approval, the packaging costs and changeover costs would have been greater than making it all at one time, in October.

That's how much business is being done in the 68 stores that they are going to have to dispose of. I can assure you, they don't have any contemplation that they're going to get $2 billion from whomever for those 68 stores. Some of these stores we'll just work with Federated to for them to sell the store to another department store. And so it could just be a cooperation move, where it involves no dollar figure. 
 When Federated bought Carter Holly Hill, there was no exchange of dollars between us, but there were many changes made to the center, as we allowed Federated to take maybe an imperfect configuration of a Broadway store, allowed them to change that, and then they allowed us to do certain things in the way of expanding it.

Well, they have a covenant at the Macy's store that they want to sell to operate thats as a Macy's. So we do have things to talk about to each other.

 I agree with you that they are trying to do what is wise for Cisco; and that is to sell it on top of their modular switches rather than trying to compete on the fixed market, on the stand-alone market, where they had a productline, CSS, that is dropping in market share all the time and is almost now nonexistent.

But it is not really targeting the core Layer 4/7.

 If you look on this physical 6500 switch or whatever, now the customer will have to put a blade for CSM, for Layer 4/7, a blade for AON for this XML capability, a blade for IDS in order to do some security on the application later, and a blade for SSL, etc. etc. So in order to provide a Layer 4/7 solution, you find yourself buying the 6500 fully equipped with many, many blades.

If we see a term opportunity that justifies the amortization of the expense over the life of the term and gives us a decent profit, then we will do it. 
 Day rate increases, I think, drive you more toward new construction rather than pulling stuff from the stack fleet. It is a balancing act. I don’t know that we have any perfect paradigm for coming to a good conclusion, but generally speaking, the older vessels, we are going to look for term rather than day rate increases to justify their re-employment. Bill, it is also – this is Keith, right quick – I think it is more a factor of the market. The 15 vessels that we have stacked are not the lower specked 180s. The lower specked 180s which were 2,000 horsepower, small liquid [muds], small bulk, we impaired that vessel fleet now a year-and-a-half ago. The 15 that we are talking about are 3,900s. We are talking about the boats with the bigger bulk, so last quarter we actually took three vessels out of stacked and we went to the lower specked 180s because the market increase was available at that level. So what we really need is we need more of a pick up in rig activity or additional rigs for the 15 that we are talking about versus construction or so. So it is not so much the day rate side, but it is the market within the market that needs to pick up a little further before Jeff gets to those 15 particular vessels. And Keith made a good point. I mean, with the rig count flat and it has been relatively flat – it jumped up a little bit this past week to 100 on the Baker Hughes count, but you really do not see a whole lot of drivers unless you are taking somebody else’s job to pull something out of stack. We have some healthy debate around here. Jeff keeps trying to get me to pull some out of stack and I am dragging my heels because I am hearing the same thing you are hearing about rigs leaving the Gulf. Jeff and his team are doing such a great job with the units that they have, every once in a while I will open my hand and let him pull one out. It is – I would say that construction activity though is sometimes ignored.

We had the ability therefore to set the overall limits lower initially, and they are beginning to knock on the door and we have raised rates a number of times in those markets. 
 Dallas, when we acquired it, had a very high spot load. We frankly brought it down initially when we acquired it, and we've subsequently made these further reductions. When we acquired it from Sunburst in 2000, their inventory load was even higher.

 But for the moment we are not putting more hedging in place since we want to see how the copper price performs in the next months. After the summer period, we're seeing steel some signs of a strong market. However, many analysts are forecasting that there will be a lot of pressure on the downside. However, we are not expecting a strong decrease in copper prices in the near-term. And if they drop, the degradation will reduce, so the prices for next year might remain at a similar level.
 On the Moly hedging, unfortunately there is no way to capture these prices. There is no terminal market for the Moly, and therefore, there is no way to hedge it directly.

So while the industry has certainly lost a number of rigs, I believe the number is either 10 or 11, due to the two storms, Katrina and Rita, none of those rigs were rigs that were currently in the employ of EPL. 
 So the rigs we had prestorm, came back to drilling position immediately after the storms. As we look forward into our '06 program, we're taking the rigs that we have under contract, we're adding to that, and we don't anticipate any immediate problems as we start the program now. Obviously the rig situation is tight. Rodney? I would just add to what Rick was saying and specifically in the question as you mentioned that there are about Denali. 
 The Pride of Georgia is a rig that we've had under contract for a while. We've used it a couple of years now. It is currently working as noted in the conference call this morning on South Pass, I believe it's 29 #1. We'll move to 39 #1, and the followup behind the 39 #1 I believe is the Denali well. So spudding Denali is pretty well set in our rig schedule at this particular point in time, with equipment that we currently have under contract. 
 We are also out, as you know, with the rigs that were lost in the storm, crew availability is pretty good at the moment, because those crews are looking for places to go to work. And there is available equipment that has been cold stacked, and continues to sit across the Gulf.

As you also know in the Spacelabs area, as the Ultraview product line continues to go into the whole replacement base, it has better manufacturing gross margin. So, you're absolutely right that in the Q2, in the Q3 and the Q4 as far as manufacturing gross margin goes, the healthcare group should continue to show better manufacturing gross margin. 
 Regarding the answer to your second question is that no, we are not saying that there were record bookings for all product lines in the healthcare group. Monitoring showed a very healthy growth.

 And I think you'll also see as part of that innovation more technology brought into our product development. The products may be characterized as more - - or smarter products that can adapt to the environment as opposed to manually control. You will see more investment in branding.

Irritrol is in the number three brand in residential and commercial integration. And Exmark is the number one brand in landscape contractor equipment.

 So when you're acquiring a business and you're not entirely sure about who's going to be kept and who's not going to be kept, it's a nicer environment for employees to come across knowing that if they're not kept, at least they get their severance pay. And we think that's an important part of the hearts and minds of bringing people over.
 Clearly there will be savings. And some of those will be in the employee line. It's fair to say that a lot of the savings and integration costs are coming from cutting short contracts on IT and comms and other links which we will have to pay to sever and which we can't sever -- we can't leave them behind because we need some of those links to continue to run the business.

There are parts of the program that the state of Florida will be taking over themselves. And then they will be turning that over to kind of an RFP process to any vendor who wants to fill that need with that. And at that time Pfizer and Pfizer Health Solutions will determine if we want to continue our involvement with the state of Florida. 
 But one of the things we have been working very hard on is getting Florida to the point where they can have this be a sustainable program with the help of some others, perhaps, but after five years we wanted to get them a little bit on their own legs. The very important message from this program, of course, is that you achieve better health outcomes and significantly lower costs by managing care, putting the patient at the center, rather than managing cost, which points the payer at the center. David, do you just want to add any more to variability? Yes. I think in large part the issue of variability is a function of a lot of good news. So when you take a look at the fact that the Company is going through a major restructuring effort and has been able to accelerate it quite significantly. That subjects that benefit to the Company to a certain degree of ranges and variability. 
 We have an opportunity we will talk about on February 10 in terms of a large number of new products, and they are going to define the new Pfizer. And obviously, their availability, their penetration into global marketplace, which will define the future of Pfizer, offers the natural degree of variability associated with any new product. And then increasing access to what we do in terms of our pharmaceutical medicines through things like Medicare Part D will drive a certain degree of variability as well. The variability is being driven in many, many respects by favorable things that the Company looks forward to and obviously has to navigate well. And on the Florida Healthy State Program -- Karen reminds me that we're replicating the fundamental message here that access to medicines and access to care reduces costs and improves outcome -- is we're replicating this study in the Medicare population as one of only eight pilots authorized by HHS.

Most of the patients are either paying the copay or they are in private plans that cover the price of Lipitor. So we expect minimal impact on (technical difficulty). This is another interesting example of a failed policy. In an effort to control costs the German government continues to use government price controls to push down price. The result is every year cost goes up. What we are advocating and demonstrating in many places around the world is that by managing care, by putting the patient at the center, you achieve your objectives of better outcomes and lower cost much more effectively than through government price controls.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
1199356_T,1,"{52,53,54,55,56}","Well, I think on your second one on marketing productivity, specifically sales force, I’ll give a perspective and ask Tony to also give a perspective. Maybe ask Martin to talk a little bit about marketing productivity projects a bit more broadly. On the how much externalization should we do, we won't do four deals a month. It’s not quite the capacity that we can handle. But I wouldn’t say to you that we have a specific target that we would share. 
 I think the question earlier about what's our planning cycle, how do we look at the portfolio, I think we look at the portfolio in value terms, as well as in terms of the numbers of compounds that are in different stages of development and the risk profile that each one of them has. And I -- it is the integral of a number of those factors, I think, that causes us to get a sense of where we’re headed, and then we go out and look. 
 It’s for the very reason that each product has a different profile and potentially represents a different point of view -- a different value point. It’s hard to put a number on it specifically. I think the market opportunities in diabetes in some of the emerging markets are significant, and we want to take advantage of those as well. 
 So I don’t want to put a number on it. I think we will know when we have enough. We’ll be confident in the attrition rates. Johannes here, he may want to comment on the attrition rates about this. But we’re not satisfied yet, Jo, I can tell you that. 
 There was the sales and marketing question around productivity. Martin, you want to comment a little bit on marketing productivity? Well, this is, of course, a very important question and we've put a lot of emphasis in improving our marketing productivity. And we have had a program in place for almost 18 months, together with our commercial colleagues, to really experiment on new practice and new way of enhancing value around our products, which not necessarily have to be around new labels and new clinical trials, but it’s part of the mix. 
 So it’s definitely a high priority and we start now to see the outcome of that work. And we scrutinize all our existing brands to revitalize them, and we build and shape the new brands in Phase II and Phase III towards those new demands. So I'm pretty optimistic that we will set new standard as we move forward. Tony, you want to comment on sales force size in the U.S. and what you see happening with some of the other companies or where we’re headed? Sure, I’d be happy to. Relative to the U.S. market, we have certainly seen some sales force size contraction. I think a number of our competitors have pulled back for a number of different reasons. I can give you our approach to what we -- how we look at sales force size. 
 For us, we have two primary objectives, the first being how can we increase market value in a responsible way? And then second is how do we best deploy our sales force so that we can enhance customer relationships? And as we have improved our own productivity measures, we leverage outside sales groups, contract sales organizations. 
 We found that, as we have increased our own productivity, we've also been able to down titrate our reliance on contract sales organizations. We expect that we will continue to find efficiencies in our operating model, and that will allow us to further down titrate some of the reliance on contract sales groups. So our approach is one about creating market value and doing so that builds better customer relationships, and we think we’re on the right track. I would only add to it, Jo. I think some companies will be driven by financial need or a lack of products that they have to promote in the marketplace, because of patent expiry, so. 
 We’ve got a call on line two from Stefan Wikholm. Why don’t we go to that? He’s been holding for a few minutes now. Stefan, are you there? Okay. We’re running out of time. We’ll take one more question here from the floor and then we’ll wrap it up. Over here, please.",test,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

1207852_T,1,{30},"[Translated]. Well, the government doesn’t have to guarantee anything. What the government has said is respect for business freedom. And what it has said very clearly is that of those assets that have to be invested they’ve said which should be disinvested through an auction procedure or as Minister [Solvis] said others should be sold as agreed by the agents. And he said that the gas contracts to be disinvested should be carried out through a transparent public auction. And the other parts don’t have to be auctioned. He said this clearly.
 And regarding no guarantees. Well, it’s not the government’s job to provide guarantees. The two companies need to come to agreement. But the government has said that this is an agreement independent of the takeover bid. And this agreement independent of the takeover bid for the buying of assets between two sovereign companies. If those companies had the technical, economic capacity they’ve solvent competitive etc., etc., they’ll have no objections if there is nothing that effects the competition issue. And as Jose [Montilla Aguillera] has explained of all our assets there are only some that are subject to competition which is electricity generation. All the others are regulated. And according to Function 14 it has to be determined whether the buyer has technical, economic solvency, competitive ability which I think is something that we comply with. So we will see whether the generation we plan to buy in the Peninsula can affect it or not.
 But I repeat the words of Jose Montilla Aguillera again. The doctrine that has been applied to this case and in previous concentrations is that the resulting companies none of them should have a production share more than the biggest agent before the operation. And this is complied with in our agreement. And in the specific case of our agreement, the Company mixes are better balanced solving some of the competition problems because no one is dominant in setting the prices.
 So there are positive measures that improve and measures that do not worsen the situation. And therefore we consider what the government has already said, the line that’s going to followed is going to be more than clear. That they are sovereign. So as I say, it is limited to a specific issue, generation, since the rest are regulated assets.
 And regarding Europe, the Spanish government has nothing to say because it doesn’t come under its competence.
 And regarding Plan B in Portugal. Well we only have one plan, our strategic plan which ends on 2006 that we have extended until 2008 or 2009 where we will continue to work with combined cycle plants and wind plants. We have 15,000 records being developed in wind power. If we can install 15,000MW in various countries I think we will more than cover our investments for this year. So there’s no Plan B, there’s a plan we have and if this operation is successful, as we have always said, we are not looking corporate movement. So we studied those that are put to us, and when those that are put to us are interesting we go for them. And when they’re not interesting we don’t go for them.

 We provide the laser at no charge in return for - or hope for volume of catheters and when we do the analysis it turns out that our catheter volumes in our Cap-free program, Cap-free hospitals are exceeding the catheter volumes in hospitals that have had either purchased lasers or acquired them earlier. So we are in fact achieving higher volume. 
 And I think what we've also tried to do is go through a very efficient targeting program where we get information on the total number of coronary and peripheral interventions done in the hospital. We get an idea of the number of high volume interventions and we put pretty strict criteria in front of our sales force to ensure that we touch all those bases before we even offer them a Cap-free program.

1219283_T,1,"{5,6,7,9,12,13,14,16,17,18,19,20,21,23}","Okay, I will start with debt pushdown. I think first, we have -- when we were on the road during the IPO -- road show -- we said that we had pushed down EUR500 million, roughly, of debt from the temporary finance to the holding companies just above Eutelsat SA. This is still the case. So we have not changed the debt push down.
 But what we have done now recently is that we have paid a dividend, a distribution of reserves for [EUR160] million in December 2005. And yesterday, basically, the Board of Eutelsat SA has voted an interim dividend of [EUR19] million to accelerate cash upstreaming from Eutelsat SA to Eutelsat Communications.
 So basically, we do everything upstream as fast as possible. And what we have done also -- and this was part of our December -- this has been voted also in December -- is that there has been a reduction in share capital of Eutelsat SA for EUR346 million, which has been done from share capital to share premium. This now gives a EUR346 million distributable reserve, which we have not touched so far.
 So we contemplated and we think about the structuring issues on the debt pushdown or more generally about the tax inefficiency, so quoted, of the structure and it is part of my working plan over the next half-year. I would hand over maybe to Jean-Paul about Hispasat. Yes, on Hispasat, I just want to say that we continue to express interest of increasing our stake in Hispasat. Hispasat is for us a quite important strategic partnership to be present in Spain and also to expand in Americas, South America and to some extent in North America.
 And we are working on establishing the right conditions for being able to make this increasing of our participation. As you mentioned, there is one condition which is in fact to have really approvals or agreements from the Spanish government, and we are working on that. Then I think the third question was what is going about the hedging. You talk about financial hedging? Okay. As far as the financial hedging is concerned, I think we have -- but I will restate this -- we have not changed basically the hedging policies. Everything -- all the contracts have been implemented in April and May '05, and basically we have in terms of hedging, at the Eutelsat SA level, we have swapped the term loan, i.e. EUR650 million at 3.415%. So this part is basically fixed debt on the [entire] maturity of the term loan, i.e. 7 years.
 As far as the separate, i.e. Eutelsat Communications, debt is concerned, we have implemented the [color] for the first year -- three years from -- so 2005, 2006, 2007, and it is maturing in April 2008. It is a color 2.15 to 3%, so it caps at 3% on EUR1.7 billion. So this debt is completely hedged for the three years.
 Then we have for two years after -- it is part of our -- it is in the IOM, and we have implemented a forward swap for EUR800 million for years 4 and 5 -- on EUR850 million, I said; and the other EUR850 million we have implemented the cap. I think it is 4%. So it gives a blended hedging at -- well, a cap rate at around 3.68%. So does this answer your question? Two quick questions. Firstly, what is the most likely new orbital slot for HOT BIRD 3? Secondly, is it possible for you to quantify the negative revenue impact that the anomaly of the W1 had on the value-add services business in the first half? Yes, concerning the (indiscernible) line -- concerning the most possible orbit, we are looking to three possibilities; at the moment, I cannot elaborate on that because I don't want to give too much (indiscernible) around. But one of the three options is that possibly to put the satellite in what we were mentioning during the road show, an orbital position near the 13 degrees in such a way that Number 3 could be used for TV.
 And at the same time it could be in orbital position, where if there is an explosion in HDTV, some of the capacity to be taken over there. So it is not a reposition; it is in [richer] of 13 degrees. There are other two options that are possible and which we will decide in the course of the next month, 1.5 months, because we are not going to remove HOT BIRD 3 until after placing into orbit and testing of Hot Bird 8, which will be in June/July of this year. Therefore, we have time to look.
 We have been looking at all the three options, and another (indiscernible) option that we have (indiscernible), we will wait that we can meet this increased revenue that we are certifying in the new guidance with a little differences.
 But I would prefer option that would be -- not to be too far from the HOT BIRD position at the moment in such a way that we can keep ourselves for some time (indiscernible) at the beginning of the life as an additional spare in case of any failure. Because we want to have additional security to protect our orbital position.
 Concerning the D-STAR, in the case of the W1 failure -- I couldn't say failure --- partial failure -- in fact we lost half of the power of the satellite, but we adopted a measure to put some clients somewhere else. So for those ones, we did not lose revenue. And what we did for those to (indiscernible) more and corresponded to another variable.
 The only one that was suffering, in fact, that we had a loss for the D-STAR, because a great part of the customers from the Middle East was on that particular satellite and we had to reduce the amount of customers there.
 So the net result for this was in terms of terminal, we lost more than (indiscernible) units in the Middle East. In terms of revenue for the year, we can say that it's difficult to evaluate because it is a question to see how the customer would have continued if everything was okay. So I don't want to overevaluate, but we can say that we are in the range between 1.5 and EUR1.7 million, maybe EUR2 million in the most pessimistic assumptions, due to this loss for the customer. The major loss is in the Middle East.
 And we would like to compensate that with European (indiscernible) because (indiscernible) where this satellite is not effective, the cash position. In fact, some of the cash flow already moved to another satellite. I hope this satisfies your question. Yes, thank you. Basically just a clarification. When you explain that the year-on-year movement in operating expenses, you mentioned some costs related to the insurance policy. If you could elaborate what is the current insurance policy for modeling purposes, so we could have an easier projection going forward.
 Second question would be regarding the timing of the basically the bringing forward of the procurement for HOT BIRD 9. If you could go through the main characteristics of this BIRD in terms of transponders and explain why the additional costs will be only EUR80 million, why. So that's it. Thank you. Thank you for the question. I will start on the in-orbit insurance. What we had -- maybe you remember during what we explained in the IOM, the previous policy was we had three slices of in-orbit insurance policy. And this was going from November '04 to November '05. These three slices were from 0 to EUR80 million, one tranche. Then we had another slice from 80 to EUR110 million. And we had the last slice, which went from 110 to EUR180 million aggregate losses.
 Each BIRD was insured for -- I think 15 out of 18 owned satellites were insured partly or fully under the 0 to [EUR80] million policies. The 0 to [EUR80] million policy expired in November, 2005, and it was quite expensive. I think you remember that we indicated that on last fiscal year, we had roughly [315] -- or EUR20 million of in-orbit insurance costs.
 So what we have decided, and I think we have mentioned this during and before -- before and during our IPO, is that we cut out basically the 0 to EUR80 million slice and we have our insurance program now is that we are not insured. We are self-insured from 0 to EUR80 million aggregate. And afterwards, in terms of aggregate losses, we are insured between 80 and EUR470 million, i.e. for EUR390 million, and insured to a maximum of EUR165 million per satellite, i.e. we could sustain three complete satellite losses. We would suffer an EUR80 million loss, which we cover, and the rest, we would be insured.
 Now the question for the modeling purposes, basically as we have cut out the most expensive part or let's say not the most -- but an expensive part of our in-orbit insurance coverage, I think in terms of modeling, you should take a lower in-orbit insurance cost than the 20 which we had on a yearly basis, where we had half of the year this 0 to 80 layer and half of the year we did not have it.
 So I think we are not going to disclose the exact amount for competitive reasons. But in terms of modeling, you can consider that the in-orbit insurance costs will be lower than the ones which we had last year. Concerning the HOT BIRD fleet, the situation is a little bit complex. But I'll try to simplify that. It is not exactly what I am saying because if I could go through all the details it would take half an hour. But let's take a bit. And the HOT BIRD has got around -- an ultimate position around 100 transponders -- (indiscernible). And this 100 transponder roughly, we can divide it in groups of 20 transponders each.
 So to have this HOT BIRD 9, we are in front of two possibilities. To have a satellite with two groups of transponders equivalent, which is around 40 transponders, or to have a (indiscernible) with a group of three transponder equivalent, around 60 transponders.
 In fact, these two considerations (indiscernible) correspond to what we are launching in the next two months, HOT BIRD 7A, which is a 38/40 transponder satellite, (indiscernible) HOT BIRD 8, with 58 to 60 SA transponder satellite (indiscernible). We have been looking through these two options and finally, although it would have been very difficult to put up there, the strongest, the highest, most beautiful we chose HOT BIRD 8, we took a prudent approach and we have chosen as a configuration HOT BIRD 9 a satellite similar to HOT BIRD 7A. Let's strategy the HOT BIRD 7A, a bit of it, if you like.
 Which means a satellite capable to have two sets of frequency as a basic. Being this (indiscernible) it takes a set of (indiscernible), and being capable in the second set, the other 20 or so transponder, 20 frequency plans of HOT BIRD 2, HOT BIRD 3, and HOT BIRD 4.
 Other than the equipment of the HOT BIRD 8, which is essentially with the three sets of frequency and capable to spare everything. Which means HOT BIRD 1, HOT BIRD 2, HOT BIRD 3, and HOT BIRD 4 and HOT 6, this is the simplified action. Together, we are putting -- we will increase obviously -- we (indiscernible) of flexibility, but now not as much as we would have had with HOT BIRD 8.
 Now what is the mystery of the 80 million? Why all the 80 million? Clearly, a satellite does not cost 80 million; it costs much more. I cannot disclose to you now what we actually pay for the satellite, because obviously I will have a problem with industry. I tell you that the industry made a very, very big effort because they are very much interested in this approach.
 There is a lot of recurring costs only, because we don't have a new development, because we strictly took a model of a satellite we have already (indiscernible). So that is what makes the cost less. (indiscernible) a few effective engineer chains every five minutes for the (indiscernible) that people never showed before. So it's strictly the same order because if it works, it works.
 (indiscernible). And the difference between the price of the satellite and the 80 million is the savings that we are capable to do in the (technical difficulty) I lost the last bit. Sorry. So I say -- I'm talking about the savings. So clearly, the satellite will not cost EUR80 million. EUR80 million is the (indiscernible) between the cost of the satellite, which unfortunately I cannot tell you because the industry would not like -- the price is very low -- and the savings that we are going to make that we have demonstrated already to us, to ourselves and to our Board, if they are going to make in those CapEx plans for the other satellites.
 A bit here and a bit there, it sums up to something that the debt is EUR80 million. So it is not EUR80 million per year; it is EUR80 million altogether on the EUR900 million (indiscernible) spend your CapEx, including 2006 and the other three years. Okay, thank you.

I think that we've articulated well in the Q the current status of the DOJ investigation into our waste water pretreatment facility at Acuity Specialty Products. It's been an ongoing investigation and we have been complying fully with their request. We received an additional request for information under a subpoena, which is, again, typical and normal in these types of things, and so we continue to provide them with that information. We continue to do our own investigation. So I believe that, again, as we've described, the Company really believes that the misconduct was by that of a former employee. It was not directed by anyone or known to us at senior management, of either ASP or the Company. And so we feel that, ultimately, the end resolution of this, which we would hope to do relatively quickly, but unfortunately we don't completely control that, will not result in any material impact. We believe that we have adequately accrued for what the potential exposure could be.
 And, again, I would also point out that what we're dealing here with is phosphorus, and we have significantly upgraded our pretreatment facilities over the course of the last, really, handful of years, and it's the city of Atlanta that we actually have the permit and completely comply with and are working very well with the city of Atlanta. And as we have noted earlier, we settled all issues around this issue with the city of Atlanta.

1278026_T,1,"{27,29}","Okay. Let me see if I got the -- and I will answer the three most important. One is timing, the second is the safeguards and the third, why did we pick them?
 The why did we pick the move to Mexico was really based on the margin potential that we can get. We do not want to sacrifice on the quality of the fabrics we're using because they really are the -- the quality of the fabric and the wash are the two most important parts of components of a jean. And I would say really the fabric is the building block, obviously, of the jean.
 So we needed to find a way to increase our margins. We're not going to take our price points up. We're still going to be in that 143 to $179 jean range. We think that that is our sweet spot. And in light of that, in order to get a 50 point margin, we really need to, without compromising on the piece goods or the fabric, as it is called, we needed to find a place to manufacture this cheaper. So that led us to the conclusion that we needed to go down to Mexico.
 Why did we pick AZT? One is the existing relationship, but most importantly, if we tried to go down to any third party down in Mexico, the development would come into question. And so AZT actually has a development wash facility up here in the U.S. that mirrors what they have done in Mexico.
 So we do all of our development in the U.S. It is quick, it is fast, the turnaround -- it's a great laundry. And then what that affords us to do is to go down to Mexico with the exact same laundry, the exact same formulas and know that we're going to hit what we did here in the U.S.
 It is very difficult to go to a third-party independent laundry that does development only, and there are a number of them here in L.A., but you are in essence going to have to knock your wash off down in Mexico, and that is a very difficult and time-consuming process. So it was really the match-up of L.A. development matching up directly with what is down in Mexico.
 Now what that also affords us to do is if we need quick reorders without having to go down to Mexico, we can obviously cut and sew goods here in the U.S. and wash them at the laundry here in L.A. So it helps us on time to market, it helps us on margin, and we definitely are not going to sacrifice on development.
 In terms of the safeguards, we have our own QCs on the ground down in the factory in Mexico. So we have launch QCs and we have sewing QCs, and both of which were trained here in L.A. and have been with the Company for a number of years, so they know the product very well. And so just like they'd go in the field in QC here in L.A., they're down in Mexico QC-ing. And in terms of the timing, we moved as of last month. We moved -- all new styles are starting down in Mexico. I'm sorry. We started this process, gosh, almost -- what would it be? -- eight or nine months ago. So all-new styles delivering 3/30 and on. We are already starting to see -- and we had done a bunch of tests in between that. But in terms of doing the full move, which meant shipping all of our trims and all of our fabric down to Mexico, that was as of the end of last month.
 All of our inventory basically went down to -- or the vast majority of it went down to Mexico. So what I am calling our move to Mexico is something that has taken place over the last nine months.

Barry, the good news to me is the backlog that you have increased, where you doubled your backlog from '04 to '05. At what rate can you start to hire -- I guess, in other words, to increase that production to start in -- I mean, obviously by whittling down that backlog, it increases your profit, increases sales, and so on. I mean, it's good to have a backlog, and you said you've expanded the plants and so on. But at what rate -- is the backlog growing at a faster rate than you can build the product, I guess is -- Well, it was initially. However, we've taken several steps to pull that backlog down. So it's nice to have a big backlog, but then your leadtime push out. So what we have done is -- there was a detailed discussion about what we have done to the physical plants for capacity. And in addition to that, along with that, we have ramped up the hiring of additional employees to increase production. In the ClientMaster, facility, which is where probably we've seen the biggest backlog increase, in that operation -- we have gone from four -- we were working -- we had that plant working on four 10-hour days as opposed to five 8-hour days. And we had set it up initially that way so that if we had a bulge in production, we could work overtime on the 5th day of the week.
 Well, what we have done with that operation is we've gone to some partial second shifts, and we've also gone to -- in addition to four 10s to three 12s in certain areas. So in some areas of the plant, we're actually running around the clock. Okay, so the Oklahoma City has the workforce to continue to expand that production facility. And obviously, you are buying the plant. We're are [hiring in] and we're gearing up in all of these places. So even if you continue to grow at a rate of -- well, obviously, I don't think you'll grow at -- I'd like to see you double your backlog every year.

We do have Margie on the call today. I'm looking over at her, if there is anything she wanted to add. Yes. I think what I would add is we were recently at the big VoIP show a couple of weeks ago here in Silicon Valley.

Remember, this is one where you get it, you start charging for it, but it's subject to final approval, which we haven't received yet. It took Aqua Source almost 3-1/2 years to get their case. We're in our second year now of testimony and everything else. They do a very, obviously, thorough job. But we anticipate Q3 this year, at worst Q4, getting a final ruling, at which point we know if we bonded and reserved the right amounts, and so on.

I doubt that would be the case, because there's never been any indication that there's anything but -- they agree with what we're doing. Here's another state where we had a consent decree, which was about 120 items long. We're down to getting full relief, because we've been spending about $30 million to fix all these problems that were left to us by Aqua Source.

The expense deferral is the part that accounted for all the gain in the first year, right? Well, three-quarters of it. The first year was about a quarter revenue and three-quarters expense deferral. And that gets tweaked. Every time there's an increase in the billing, the expense deferral goes down by that amount so that your pre-tax income is consistent. So our O&M ratio is adversely affected in Texas, even though it's not new expense the next three years. Sure. When you compare to last year, it looks like expenses went up by that million dollars, but really it was a decline in deferral. Right. Now, the good news is we're going 6 or 7% in Texas.

And the main part of that - we won’t be more specific - but the main part from that comes from the field of activity of the co-generation. And, as I said, this is a pretty seasonal effect.
 Most of our businesses experience – have been impacted by that. But I would say that the one which was the most impacted are probably Polyamide, Organics and probably to a less extent Silcea. But this is the reason why we indicate in the fact sheet that we provided, we indicated in a column, which is called scope all these type of effects.
 For the full year, we not give you a precise guidance for our Energy Services. But, as I said, this is a pretty seasonal effect, meaning that we have most of the EBITDA for this into clients in Q1 and in Q4. And meaning that we don’t expect for Q2 and Q3 something that would be very material in terms of EBITDA. Just -- if I may just add one comment on that. Clearly, in Energy Service he is part of our business, especially on the [circulation] and the supply of electricity, gas and steam for the Group. I think we do that very good now in this area.
 And we used to take advantage, especially on the volatility that we see in some period of time, and it was the case in Q1 on the electricity and gas market. So, you shouldn’t look at this as windfall or exceptional profit. It’s really something which is part of our business. We make sure that we optimize the sourcing of gas and electricity. And I think we are getting quite good at it.
 We are giving you more visibility, because we are now booking all of these activities under Energy Services and we are reporting that as a separate unit. But once again, it’s everything that we’ve done for the past three or four years. And this is quite successfully.
 On the CER, well, it’s clear the situation on the carbon credit, the situation is rather complex. What I can share you is that the ETS scheme, the European emission scheme is divided in two periods. The first one ’05 to ’07 was looked at as the test period. And then we had a second period ‘08 to ‘12.
 So, when the allocations were made at the beginning of ’05 they were based on that part which has been made available a couple of years before on data which were not verified by the independent expert. So, we all knew -- all the people who are familiar with market knew that there were some uncertainties regarding the actual level of emission and how it relates to the amount of credits which given.
 Now, for the first time we are beginning to have specific data which has been verified by independent expert. And it turns out that emissions are probably -- are less than expected, at least regarding the countries who have published their number. And it means that the market is probably under less pressure than people -- than some people expected. So, hence, the significant fall that we’ve seen in the first phase ETS European advances.
 So, what do we expect now? First, there should be a report next week with the remaining countries, the ones which have not published their data yet. So, at this point of time we’ll have a full view of what’s the situation in the market regarding emission -- actual emissions and allowances.
 I think the European Commission is probably working on some ways to bring back some stability and some visibility on the market. But at the moment I don’t have any informed view on what could be this -- the short term measure. But more important than that, at least for us, I think that the European Union members countries are working to make sure that in the second phase allocations are based on actual verified numbers regarding emissions. And it’s why I think we should see, starting in 2008, a market which will be -- which will provide opportunities for us to value our CER in good conditions.
 There were various comments made by European Commissioners and countries’ Minister of Environment regarding these points. So, I’m rather -- I’m not especially worried with what we’ve seen on the market in this past few weeks.

And for example, in the collaboration with Chelsea now, we get access to expertise within rheumatoid arthritis that we heretofore have lacked. So that’s one part of the strategy change and the CCR1 project doesn’t fit in for that reason.

 As it relates to MOVA generally, we are anticipating that it will be profitable in the fourth quarter of this year.

And as you said, we've done a pretty good job in recent years of predicting that timing and bringing them into backlog. We've got a very rigorous filter as far as when we actually take a job into backlog. And it is required -- it's got to pass certain tests in terms of documentation and commitments and funding.

 Now, on CO2 and on renewables, as you can see, we -- and as I have said, we want to increase the intensity of our investments in renewables. And we'll be ramping up the investment over the next few years, from what is admittedly a relatively low base to something in the order of EUR1b, EUR1.5b a year in the first four or five years of the next decade. I say that with this qualification, that we're still working on our mid-term plan. None of that has been really put into concrete, but it gives you an impression of what we're thinking of at the moment.
 You asked about a geographic split. Well, we are leaders in renewables in this country. We want to defend that position. So there will be a significant investment in Great Britain. There will be investments in Germany, in France, in Poland, in Spain and perhaps in some other countries, but those are the main ones that I can see at the moment.
 When you think of what renewables, then my guidance would be roughly, and again I emphasize roughly, a third in hydro and two-thirds in wind. And of that wind, maybe one-third onshore, two-thirds offshore. That's about as detailed as I can get at this point in time, but it should give you a feel for where our current thinking is.
 The main thing that we are trying to convey here with this chart is that RWE makes a very serious intent known of tackling its CO2 emission levels.

Our objective is to do as you suggested, which is to drop more of the WOW savings down to the bottom line, which means that although our expenses may be going up, what we're focusing as a percentage of sales and gross profit dollars, that's where we're looking to get greater efficiencies as we start to anniversary some of these investment projects.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

When we involve the 57%, the growth of the recruitment will be lower the [others] in comparison with the first groups. This is the first consideration.
 Second, increasing the recruitment we will have a growth in the turnover the number of new advisor that will leave the Company. When we started to recruit a lot we have -- we had a turnover based in a few number of new recruitments, okay, and for this reason we will have an increase in the turnover considering 1,700 new advisors but we have to make another consideration. We are checking the characteristics of the new advisors that leave the Company. For example, last month not one of the new advisors recruited with the method ICoNA left the Company. We think that the turnover, in comparison with the past, will decline a lot, but it is too early to have the right numbers. Okay? You had a question about the new business.

We -- Pete and his team did a fabulous job seeing our way through that. We only cancelled 3 flights, which was a lot different than what some other people did. So we think that we operated very strongly through that. John mentioned that we saw some effect on the revenue side, but we didn't classify it as material. As you well know, identifying and isolating what is exactly due to the London terrorist incident versus the normal seasonal pattern, is very, very difficult. We clearly saw some choppiness in post August 10th environment, in terms of the booking environment. We saw a fall off of bookings, as John would add here, but it recovered. And so it's really hard to nail down a number. But I'm convinced that we saw less effect than some of our competitors did. And part of that was we were really solidly booked going into the event.

 In the Academic sector, we're seeing growth in the mid single digits. The growth -- industry growth is typically seen about 2 to 3% and we're seeing up to twice that. It depends very much on the country. As you know, public funding is very different in the various countries.
 The second area within Life Sciences is the Pharma sector, and there we're showing very rapid growth. This is one of our fast growing segments. It is probably twice as fast as the overall growth of the Company, organic growth, and it is primarily driven by increased use of our products in the clinical environment. Not preclinical use, but clinical use. And what we have been talking about for quite some time, the increased trend towards monitoring patients on a molecular basis and the use of personalized medicine strategies, this is clearly showing quite some impact. And we expect that trend to continue as the budgets are very big in the clinical sector versus the preclinical phase.
 The Applied Testing area is small and is growing about that same rate, about twice the overall growth of the Company. This fluctuates very widely. Can be 20% a quarter and then 40% a quarter. This is on very small numbers still, and smaller -- our deals – our larger deals within that customer area can clearly be of big significance on a quarterly basis.
 And the Molecular Diagnostics business is also about two times the organic growth rate. Can be three times depending on the quarter. Fluctuates within that range.

 On the foreign programming, just to give you a better color, we are also -- we have escalation or escalators both into some of our volume deals that are anywhere from 10% to 20%, and we are actually seeing a little bit higher than that cost this year because we have made a deliberate decision to focus on quality, particularly in foreign movies. And we have been doing that as well as trying to avoid what we call the TV product in packages, where items like the series and things that we do not really -- are not as attractive to our audiences are stuff we can avoid and cherry pick, which means we pay a little bit more, but it actually make better economic sense for us.

 In terms of the hotel revenue margin, I think, as Dara mentioned earlier, we think that the economic relationships we have on the hotel side are appropriate at this time, and really reflect the value that we're delivering to the hotels. Just to comment on that further, what we are solving for long-term is the amount of cash that this business throws off. We kind of don't care whether it's high margins or low margins or high revenue growth or low revenue growth. We're solving for long-term cash generation and optimizing long-term cash generation. It may happen that we may have an environment where dropping margins is going to really drive revenue growth, which is going to result in higher profitability. We will do that. the opposite may be true as well. 
 So it's very difficult to comment on long-term trends in margins without knowing what's happening. We have some partners that we do business with today with whom our margins are actually increasing. Now, the production in their particular hotels is increasing dramatically as well, so it's a win-win situation. They get a ton of volume from us, we get high margins from them, and we both win.

The two major office buildings where we own a minority interest are on there for, whatever they're on there, for $25 million combined. We think they're worth much in excess of that book value. So, that would be one thing I point out. 
 The second thing is some of those assets are not in our control. So, like the two major office buildings, we think somewhere between 12 and 36 months we'll see a refi or a financing or sale there and that should be considerable proceeds to us.

1438404_T,1,{185},"That's a great question. I've always felt it's not size and scale alone, it's fitness. So if you're really big and you're really fit, it's one thing. But if you're big and you're unfit, it certainly is a disadvantage. The carriers do have considerable pricing leverage. There's a small number of carriers with a very limited spend. They are very ambitious plans to transition the network because they have to retool their service portfolio, both on the wireless as well as on the fixed side, and they are certainly exercising a lot of their pricing leverage.
  So I can't speak for the big guys because their strategy has been one of trying to bundle a lot of things and offer both in space and time a huge offer that has revenue recognition issues, that has margin issues. As far as we're concerned, we have found a lot of success in offering application-specific solutions, mobile back haul being a great example. We think a similar success exists in ROADMs and the transition of SONET FTH networks to ROADM DWDM networks. And we also believe that in niche pockets such success exists in fiber, except there we've got to be a little bit smart as to what kind of fiber access solutions and strategies we offer, especially with the smaller customers. So I think consolidation for consolidation sake will probably take some time to prove out if that's the right thing. There's no doubt the industry will have fewer suppliers tomorrow than today, and there will be consolidation. I think the bigger issue is what is your fitness level, how do you exercise your fitness level in a pricing environment where the customer exercises a lot of leverage, and a big portion of our customer diversification strategy is just to be able to -- just to be able to be competitive in that environment.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

 Second, on the acquisition front, no, I do not think there has been any significant change in the outlook in the market. I still think that obviously there are -- there has been significant improvement for many of our competitors as well as ourselves. And that pricing is still relatively high as it relates to acquisition opportunities. Clearly, we benefited last year in being able to find and compete effectively for the variable annuity of Allstate. 
 So my sense is we are more likely to see acquisition opportunities as folks decide they cannot compete in one or more markets as those who have scale continue to drive, if you will, the success in those markets.

Well, as you see, the situation of first talking about the raw materials, it is clear that sweetener, especially sugar, last year behaved in a way that really the second part of the year, through the end of the year, the increase in sugar prices were at the level of 20 -- I would say 20, 25%, I mean, compared with the beginning of the year or compared with the end of the previous year. So you're talking about 20 or 25% being a huge, huge increase, and most of that increase happened through the second part of the year. It basically happened through the second half of the year. So that's really impacted a lot this margin in general. We were really trying to increase prices through the end of the year and so on, which finally we achieved some price increases in basically December.

This increase took place both in OES, which means this aftermarket that we sell to our OE clients for their own dealerships. And this was in France and this was in Northern Europe, including Germany, where we have quite a strong penetration after many years of penetration of the OE business. We now need to be there more present on the OES.
 In terms of IAM, it was both in, say, Western Europe, France, Italy, Spain. It was as well +9 percent points also in Northern Europe. We increased in Eastern Europe by one-third our sales this year.

1459757_T,1,"{7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17}","Thank you. The dividend payment I assuming last year, that's the first question. On the real estate project it's not the sale and leaseback, although in some cases we will have to leaseback a portion of the buildings, but the idea is to sell only the space that we have vacant right now. It is in our agenda. This is going to be executed between this year and the coming year, the beginning of the coming year.
 We have split the portfolio of real estate properties in four portfolios actually, Prague based properties, Brno and other large cities, and the rest of the country and the fourth portfolio being the headquarters of former CESKÝ TELECOM which is an area in [Olsanska Street]. We will concentrate on the disposal of the first three portfolios during the course of this year. We are not sure we are going to be able to cash in the money before year-end so it will be on the edge of '07 and '08 when we will cash in the money, and the remaining portfolio will be hopefully sold in '08.
 Fixed mobile substitution, well you're absolutely right the Czech Republic is one of the extreme cases in fixed mobile substitution. Right now approximately 70% of total minutes are generated from mobile networks. So approximately two-thirds of total minutes, while the norm in the rest of Europe is slightly above one-third. So it's tremendous fixed mobile substitution in this country and this is to a significant extent due to the low mobility premium.
 Mobile prices in comparison to fixed prices, this is a very complex exercise because you have to input in the comparison the [mobile] fee, and this will make a comparison even more complex, but according to our estimates it's around an average two times in the Czech Republic, where in the rest of Europe is between three and four times.
 The good news is that we are every day looking more at combined minutes rather than looking at fixed and mobile, because we have a solid position in both areas. Really we don't get that much if there's a huge fixed [inaudible-highly accented language] given that the price premium is not so considerable any more. For instance last year if I remember correctly, overall minutes in our group grew by 7% which is a healthy level of growth both fixed and mobile.
 Rebranding costs, there is some rebranding costs still pending for '07, not significant and not as significant as last year. But they are included in the guidance that we provide. Hello [Dali] [inaudible-highly accented language] from [ING]. Just a couple of questions if I may first on Slovakia it seems that obviously as you mentioned the business is very successful at the beginning. We understand there was a very aggressive offer there which where you basically price inter-network calls certain low price per call rather than per minute.
 So I'm just wondering how is the economics of this going to work in case there is unexpectedly high usage on this whether you have a similar contract with T-Mobile, or whether you basically might not end up losing money on offering too aggressive pricing on this particular product?
 And also is the success continues in Slovakia with the subscribers surpassing expectations, is there a possibility that you decide to invest more in your infrastructure in Slovakia compared to the guidance that you are providing? Because if I'm correct the total CapEx in the next five years that you're talking about based on these numbers is less than $300 million which it seems to be a fairly low number for building a UMTS 2G network.
 The second question perhaps on acquisitions, is there an acquisition policy or I remember that a year ago we were basically saying that 2006 was about sorting out the merger and the Czech business and then obvious you went to Slovakia which I think is a very good opportunity, and I guess that occurred, and I think everyone fully understands that you decided to pursue it. But is there a possible statement that you're going to make now about potentially using a balance sheet of Telefónica O2 Czech Republic for more substantial acquisitions, is that ruled out or is there any comment you can mention on this?
 And third on dividends, I think it's been appreciated the level of dividends for this year but obviously there are constraints given the retained earnings and everything. And I think many people probably make the judgment that if the company found some solution how to perhaps leverage the balance sheet and pay out higher dividend that could provide some positive impact on value through both the tax effect which is maybe problematic but also bringing the cost of capital down? I mean is that what the management agrees with or are there any other constraints or considerations perhaps in this regard? Thanks. Okay, thank you [inaudible-highly accented language]. Well let me start perhaps by the second one, acquisitions. Well first of all I do not consider going to a Slovakian acquisition. I mean it was just [inaudible-highly accented language] license. So for us this is organic growth. It was a license that cost less than $4 million euros, so that shouldn't be considered an acquisition. So I don't think that we broke our word of not having an activity on M&A.
 Going forward there's nothing on the -- rather nothing on the plan. And in fact our management resources are struggling right now after including Slovakia in our portfolio. So I think that right now we have sufficient with the Czech and Slovakia. If there's something that we may look at is in the Czech Republic in the ICT business that is the only that we are exploring. But this is not very expensive, so it's a question of finding the appropriate candidate and reaching an agreement about the price.
 And giving the rates that we are setting for the investments, I think that probably that can cope within that guidance -- probably. I mean obviously if there's something [big] which I do not think we will have to review this guidance. But I don't think that's going to be the case.
 And Slovakia you mention that we -- we had quite an aggressive offer for our pre-subscription customers. I mean otherwise it's going to be difficult to try to get a customer, without offering the possibility of making calls. You know the problem that we face is that we were not able to start operations in December, so we have to take advantage of the Christmas campaign without having another one. And you know that is pretty tough to give a present to one of your friends which is useless, it's just a voucher. So we have to be a little bit aggressive.
 And we were aggressive yes on net calls which to some extent is adding us more pressure to deploy the network as soon as possible. Because obviously on this -- on net calls we are not making money even the national roaming agreement with T-Mobile. That is clear. But the rest of the valuable proposition we are not as aggressive as in this case as to Slovakian crowns and we hope that the consumer patterns of the customers will more than offset the investments that we have to do in this -- to a Slovakian/Czech offer.
 On dividends -- what else can I say? I think that we demonstrate that we like to distribute as much as possible assuming that we are not making any stupid decision in terms of taxes, and we can fulfill that commitment going forward. So as I said, 9% dividend yield I think is more than generous.
 Last year it was even more generous, in terms of dividend -- dividend yield. And I think the idea is trying to distribute as much as possible provided that we are following the rules first, and following the cash flow that we have for distribution. No hidden agenda on M&A activity at all. If that is your worrisome, none at all. Yes good day, [inaudible] from [CRB]. I've got several questions. The first one whether you can tell us something about the legal challenges in Slovakia? I mean some -- the answers, I'm sorry unsuccessful bidders you know appealing this at the Slovakian court. The second one is about some guidance on the marketing cost in 2007. And my third question is about the rise in the personnel costs in the fourth quarter, whether you can tell me like in what extent it was due to the outgoing salary increase and to what extent you do redundancies? Thank you for the questions. First, on the legal challenge in Slovakia. Well, we are extremely comfortable about the situation, and in fact you probably know that two days the council of the Slovakia telecom office turned down the claim of the general prosecutor, and now it's in the hands of the new chairman of the body to decide what to do with it.
 My personal appreciation is that the company that lost the tender is acting quite [strange], but not only in Slovakia. I mean each time that this company lost a license in any country you know that they have been bidding for all single license in all accounts in the region, but each time they are not a winner.
 Well, I don't think that they know how to lose, and they are suing every entity in the region which has not given them license. So I guess that they know what they're doing. I really don't understand, but we have extremely comfortable situation, both our internal and external lawyers are very calm and very comfortable with the situation, so I don't see a risk there.
 Marketing cost I think that we are keeping, more or less, the level of marketing costs that we incurred in '06 overall including the rebranding cost. So I think that you will probably see this line of cost at a similar level like in '06, and even perhaps a little bit more because the competition is increasing, and we need to spend a significant amount of money in explaining our new product proposition. But I don't have the details of the last one. I don't know whether you can help me with that? Related to these increase of 1% that you're referring to, you have to take into account that in the Czech Republic when you're accounting for personnel expenses, you have to look at the number of days that have been worked by the employees. And depending on that, you have to charge your accounts on the so called and take it for [inaudible] so as related to that, nothing extraordinary. I think we have time for a last couple of questions. Yes [inaudible] from [Deutsche] Bank. A couple of questions first of all about the dividend long-term target because right now you are distributing more or less 85% of your annual free cash flow. My question is whether this is a rational, long-term assumption, and whether you feel you could distribute 85% of your free cash then moving forward?
 My second question is on the headcount target, do you feel that this is the optimal level that you are having right now, or you think that the headcount could be reduced further in the coming years, and if yes, what kind of level is achievable let's say in three, four years?
 And a fourth question would be your long-term view on Slovakia because the performance is so good and is above the expectations. So the question is, whether your long-term market share target would be a little bit higher than the you indicated previously or you think you should still maintain the guidance that you provided?
 And finally when do you think when the Slovakia EBITDA could be -- the EBITDA on the Slovakia could be positive whether it's three, four, five years, what's your thought on that? And finally on the foreign expansion, just a quick question whether you think that the -- if the Slovakian project is so successful as you anticipate, will it make sense to move also somewhere else, I don't know, north, south, wherever? Thank you. Thank you. On dividends -- sorry but I won't say anymore. I think that I provide sufficient guidance. Obviously we cannot not distribute according to the legal constraints on the cash flow we are generating. We don't have [return] earnings of that amount. But I think that already give sufficient -- all that I can say about dividends to your colleagues.
 Headcount targets, we have a target of reducing the headcount this year by at least 500 people. I'm not able to comment on any headcount target going forward. Long-term market share in Slovakia, well I haven't mentioned any long-term market share. I mentioned that we expect for this year-end 5%. But I guess that a good proxy of what would be our expectations is to look at what is the situation in the Czech Republic and what is the market share that the third operator has in the Czech Republic.
 Further expansion, no we are not analyzing that possibility, as I also answer to your colleague. We are at much more in capacity in terms of managing resources. So it's not only [important] financial resources but also management resources. I think it was a clear case for growing organically in Slovakia, but I don't see the case in other neighborhood countries. And I think there was another question which I --? [inaudible - microphone inaccessible] EBITDA in Slovakia. EBITDA in Slovakia, sorry again. But the problem is that the reality is so different from the original plan, different in a positive manner. And you know that there is always a balance between acquiring more customers and an EBITDA impact.

But there were no special elements during the third quarter. So that is one point.
 I think we're confident with that. We have the strong and seeing that we have a good internal growth both in terms of loans and deposits, and we expect to see the same type of growth in the near future.

Well, the main point is the point that I made in my introductory remarks, that the&#8212;we've passed through the frontage of the storm. We've passed through the eye of the storm. And then we passed through the very edge of the storm. So I really believe that the sepsis storm is behind us, and it really left the vicinity with the announcement by the Senior Leadership Council of the Pulmonary Hypertension Association that there's no reason for there to be any change in prescribing practices. And as you know those prescribing practices have been propelling Remodulin growth at 40% a year for the past four straight years. So that's the reason for optimism.
  However, even after a storm passes, there is a lot of cleanup to be done. There are branches that are down and all that sort of stuff. And in fact, we are in a competitive environment and we need to detail parental Remodulin and parental Flolan, and certainly when you're in this type of competitive environment one has to constantly put forward the most accurate information and counterdetail any confusion that might be out there. So there's no doubt that the sepsis issue is now kind of a permanent issue on the landscape, and as you know we're going to be engaging in a multiyear study to further assess its effects. So it is a permanent fixture of the landscape. Fortunately with subcutaneous Remodulin we have the safest parental therapy, and while it does a side effect of site pain, there is an awful lot of patients, more than enough to continue us at our 40% growth rate who are able to manage the site pain and feel that the freedom associated with subcut modular is well worth the minimal discomfort that this number of patients has.
  In addition to that, though, the intravenous Remodulin has been show to be a very safe and highly effective drug for the majority of the population and what we are hearing doctors across the country say is that most of them are saying we never paused in our Remodulin prescriptions. There are a few that did, and they say, ""hey, we paused. And now we've heard the Senior Leadership Council, the Scientific Leadership Council, I should say, from the Pulmonary Hypertension Association. You guys have dealt with the issue very well. We see the facts. We're back on putting patient on IV Remodulin.""

 In order to do that, if I'm not mistaken, by 2001, on the fixed business, we invested about R$8 billion. So that was the peak of investment that we have had in this Company so far.
 So what happened is that also for tax reasons we -- and technical reasons, we use what is called fast depreciation. So we depreciate our equipment and fixed equipment in five years.

1597280_T,1,"{5,7}","Sure. As in all compensation arrangements, they cover the length of the contract that employees hire. We like long-term contracts with our employees. They tend to be at percentage payouts. So the model that attracts people to us is the opportunity to be a partner of the Company. We have what we think is a wonderful structure that shares the income of the Company directly with the employees. So the employee partners -- working partners of the Company have around 40 million shares of the Company, and one of those benefits is when the Company's offered, for example, to earn $1 a share, they would get the $1 a share. Obviously the public company would get $1 for corporate taxes and the public would own their percentage. But in this opportunity, the employees literally get the dollar share in cash. So it's an exciting structure, which brings them to the Company, number one. And then our contracts to the extent there was any up-front compensation is just amortized in our compensation schedule across the term of their contract. So it's really compensation.
  Our compensation rates are 58%, and we have said we expect them to drop a little bit over time as our broker productivity increases, but around this level, 58, 57, 56, is where we would expect it to stay. I mean, we are very good at this business. We understand this business. Lee Amaitis and Shaun Lynn, these are the best senior managers in this business. Pre 9/11 this group was number one in the world. They understand this business perfectly. The brokers love the fact that this senior management truly and deeply understands this business. That coupled with eSpeed's proprietary technology, eSpeed's got the best technology. It rolls it out, it's integrating with all of the banks of the world, it's already got its software everywhere in the world, and as it rolls out new types of software, it's getting great pick-up. So the business generally is doing very well. You saw our credit revenues up 49%. I think we are the fastest-growing Company in our space because the people like the opportunities that we have available to them, like the management, and like the structure. No I wouldn't. The fact is that it really -- broker competition tends to work out on the average across your spectrum. If you have underperforming brokers in sections of the market, your average compensation will go very high. Your best brokers are the most productive and the returns on those are actually the most beneficial. So the better your business, the lower your comp ratio. The worse your business the higher the comp ratio. I'll give you an example, if someone wants to build a rates business, we have one of the great rates business of the world, for the competitors who don't have a rates business I can try build that rates business, their compensation schedule in the rates business is off the charts high which increases their average. But I wouldn't suggest that when you're successful your comp ratios are high. In fact they are not. Your best producers have higher compensation, but then all the support staff around them that helps cover all those other accounts is comparatively less.
  On average, I don't think any of our competitors have a different business model, they're not paying for higher rates or anything like that. I think the concept is, in fact, that how well your franchises perform is what drives your overall compensation schedule when you open a new business and you're losing money in that new business, it drives your compensation schedule up. And we have one added benefit that they don't have which is our employees are receiving income from their equity ownership in the Company. They own 40 million shares of the Company and that income in the combined Company is going to be going directly to them as part of their shareholding. They have an added incentive that keeps them around on top of that. But that's outside of sort of we call the ordinary working contractual compensation. They have something in addition to that.

  As to your other question about payor mix and some of our new projects, I mean, certainly, as we think about where we're going to employ capital in the future we think about markets that are, again, tend to have a better payor mix.

  Vegas is not one of those markets. There is a large county hospital in Vegas that we do not own, and so, you know, yes. As I said in response to a question before, we do expect kind of a better than average payor mix at Centennial.

On one side you have Sanef, which on the top of the revision that it was 2.0% something. We have, in fact, on the discount of heavy trucks and mostly the traffic mix.
 Also, on the top of that you need to have in mind that in Iberpistas, which -- the capital gains -- the gross capital gains on the sale of some assets that we have in Realia have a positive impact of EUR6m.

And a final question on the let's call that the TFR policies. If I am not wrong Generali had 36,000 polices. Yesterday you had only said [27,000] if I am not wrong. Is there any reason for this -- I mean sharp difference performance Alleanza, let say that has stopped Generali Group in Italy? Thank you.

 The current phase we're in is quite a large restructuring, and dealing with some underperforming capabilities of the business, and injection of talent and learning of our current capabilities in our sales force. But within that, also transformation of the sales capability to more consulting selling. And this journey is going to continue over the next 12 to 18 months.
 How much that increase is, is within 5% to 10% over and above, but it's a lot of changes within our sales and marketing community. Perhaps I could just add, to help. The return on sales in Process Systems in key 1 of 11.5% is obviously slightly dampened by the fact that we've started this investment in sales and marketing and R&D. We have previously said that we expect Process Systems to typically be in a range of around 13% to 14% ROS, and we're not changing that view. So, although we are investing in sales and marketing and R&D, on an underlying basis, and for the year as a whole, we would expect to, if you like, fund that and still retain our previous view that we'll be in that sort of ROS range.
 So, this quarter is a low quarter. You may see other low quarters, but on an overall, underlying basis, we're not walking away from what we've previously said. Regarding the Controls volume, with respect to orders, there are a couple of things happening. First, the market demands up there is very volatile, and as you know, down, especially in North America. We've also seen Europe level out some in relationship to other quarters over the last 12 months.
 When it comes to pricing, regarding our engineered products, which we build uniquely for our customers, that pricing has been sticking, and our customers are buying more from us. When it comes to commoditized products, where we raised price and there are large opportunities for customers to go elsewhere, and we find it not of our interest to do those products at the margin levels or at the pricing levels that others can accept, we have elected, through pricing, to [exit] some of that business.

One is being part of the general conversations about market color, what is going on, where we are, where we see things headed. And we have always tried to kind of play the role as a responsible market participant, and those conversations continue.
 The other part of the conversations are on the more specific regulatory matters.

And so I will dodge that one.
 On the other question, we do have a set of products that provide for some degree of accelerated funding. As we offer those products, obviously they have got a bit more processing risk, if you will, attached to them. And so we need to engage in those only with lenders that we know very well. We have got experience with. In many cases we actually have Fannie Mae employees co-located in the shops, and there has been a burgeoning of demand for that type of service or that type of product.

 So, starting from the last, the Kiev project, Cushman has given the highest discount on the Kiev project simply because it's Kiev and simply because it's Ukraine within their political situation.
 All the legal documents, such as the lands rights, such as the building permission, such as permits and approval, are on land with the local legislation, and in some points it's even better than in the overall situation in Kiev. So basically the discount factor is only because it's Ukraine. There is no economical reasons underneath that.
 Speaking about NIIDAR projects. The NIIDAR was reevaluated because we have gone through several permits and approvals and we advanced quite a lot on that project. We have got federal planning permissions on that, and in addition to that, we have acquired more and more land which we plan to acquire within the project development and we have done that.
 So basically now we have all the land under our control, we have all the property under our control. We have started the relocation of the factory with which we improved quite a lot on the project and we have got several permits and approvals that gives us a certainty on when we're going to start and that has been the main drivers of the revaluation of the NIIDAR project.

If we -- and as we've talked about before, if I look at our auto business, we generally give away, or start the fiscal year giving away our price reductions, effective beginning of our fiscal year October 1st, and then our cost reduction activities tend to ramp-up over the course of the year. So, if you look at our historic margins in North America, you typically see Q1 being the weakest, and we sequentially improve.
  So you can't really look at Q4 and sort of fast forward into Q1 and say what are the changes.

  As we disclosed in our second quarter 10-Q in May, we were named in a class action lawsuit filing by four former employee agents of the Company. The complaint relates primarily to our policies for expense allowances and expense reimbursements for non-California agents and includes claims similar to those alleged in the Benjamin class action lawsuit we settled in 2005 relating to our California agents.
  In August, the court placed this case on a fast-track schedule. And as discovery proceeded, we learned our potential exposure was greater than we initially anticipated. For that reason, we recently engaged in mediation with the plaintiffs' attorneys and reached a proposed settlement of this claim in exchange for a payment of $3,550,000. We are working with the plaintiffs' attorneys to complete the definitive settlement documentation, which will be submitted and is subject to court approval.
  We expect to file the documentation shortly and receive court approval during the first quarter of 2008.

We expect to actually pay the settlement sometime next year.",test,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE
1679829_T,1,"{98,100,101,103}","This is Michael. Help me with the question -- that we're gaining share with the biggest players and how does that affect the smaller -- No, I think that's what happened, if you look at what happened over the last few years is the small accounts went to buying systems from us, while the larger accounts were still buying load ports and robots. And I think the transition that we're going through now is most of the larger equipment makers have now bought the front end or EPON or the atmospheric systems from us. And the next opportunity is vacuum systems. And I don't think there's any hesitation at the, with the smaller accounts because if they can get a platform that makes them competitive with the bigger player, the field is kind of the same and they compete on process performance, which I think is the value add. So I think we've only solidified the share with the smaller guys, but we're certainly concentrating and gaining share, especially with the new products at the larger OEMs. I think that to just enhance that issue, I think that the two groups look to Brooks for different things. And I think that the breadth of Brooks delivers different solutions to a smaller OEM, as Michael said, who may come to us for a system solution and finds a source of high performance at an affordable price. And I think our large OEMs look at us as an extension of their own capability. I think in our Synetics division, we are viewed literally as an extension of their factory. I think that as Michael has said, one of our great opportunities is the fact that many of the large accounts do a portion of the automation themselves in-house and they are quite comfortable to come to us and work with us and see that there are tailored solutions for their particular needs. So I think we balance the two. Hello?",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

One this is for certain, that iron ore shipments are continuing at very, very strong rates of growth. That is what is supporting the Capes. Another thing supporting Capes is the ton-mile effect. We have a lot of South American shipments taking longer, as we know, going to Asia, and therefore underpinning demand even further.
 The Panamaxes might have tempered their rise from the fact that we have had a slight reduction as we said during our presentation of congestion in Australia, primarily Australia and coal-loading ports, which are, of course, the stronghold of the Panamax trade from Australia to China. We will see when numbers have come through whether this guess on our part is indeed the cause why the Panamaxes did not perform as well as the Capes during the last few days, not that they have done badly that is. I think the way I have been received today by these five major charterers in Tokyo proves that the Panamaxes are going to follow suit with the Capes. And next week, I think we may have a slight decline on the rates of the Capes. But we will definitely have an increase on the Panamaxes.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

1684760_T,1,"{19,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30}","No, the only numbers we've published is through September. Yes, I just wonder if you'd be good enough to give us some idea of what you would tell a novice outsider the signs to look for in the publications, the newspaper, words from the Federal Reserve, that would give us some indication that the market is becoming a little bit more liquid. From what I gather, most of these problems are because there is virtually no market. It's not so much the cash payments that are being made. So just give us, if you would, your view as to what signs we could all look for that something is starting to change for the positive. I guess that's about it. It's a pretty wide-ranging question. I think to the extent that the --- Fannie and Freddy got involved at different levels -- there's been talk about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac being -- at least talk about them being able to buy either more loans or loans with higher balances. Were either of those to come true and they had a significant pick-up in the agency buying of loans, I think that would help the market some. There are a variety of both federal and state programs going on to try to help borrowers in the subprime market, which have been kind of the root cause of many of the problems -- but to help those borrowers in the subprime market that have interest rates that are going to rise dramatically at their roll dates. If there's programs to help that out one way or another, I think that would help the market in terms of slowing down the declines in market values and also getting some liquidity back in the market.
 I do think it will take awhile for the major players -- the Wall Street players, who were a big buyer of this, to come back. Normally, we would think that -- I said that there's no trading in our securities, which tend to be the lower-rated tranches of mortgage securitizations. And even in the upper levels of the credit stack, the AAA and AA, there's some, but not much trading. But as that trading picks up, that would be an indication that it would eventually spread down to the other collateral. So I think there's a number of things we could look to in terms of things getting better.
 Clearly, on the upside or the downside with our market, our market is prime loans. And the prime driver of that -- two prime drivers -- but one is the ability of people to keep their jobs and to pay their mortgages. And so far the employment numbers have been relatively good, so I would say continuing good employment numbers would help us going forward. John, what about another cut or a couple of cuts from the Federal Reserve? Do you think that would -- aside from the absolute impact, do you think that would open the market a little bit? Or really, at this stage, not have too much effect on the market? To the extent that it brought rates down for what we call the hybrid mortgages -- got the short end of the curve down and made housing more affordable on the short end of the curve -- and hybrids, which are three, five and seven year adjustable loans that go to a one-year after that period of time, which I think are a pretty good product, to the extent those are more affordable due to rate reductions, that would help a lot. Also, the last question, it seems to me that if there are yields such as we're getting, a 14% or even anything in that area, and with the dollar being so low, that there should be a whole slew of foreigners flocking to America to participate in this kind of paper. Why do you think that's not happening? Well, I think there is -- I don't know exactly, but one thing for sure is to buy the kind of paper we buy, you have to have the knowledge of the mortgage market and the systems to be able to sort out what's good and what's bad, in terms of looking at the loan levels. So it takes technology, it takes some knowledge and experience in buying that. And to the extent that -- just foreign money coming in, kind of without that infrastructure, would be hard to buy the assets and know they're getting the right ones. That being said, anecdotally, we've heard there's money coming into the hedge funds. I think that was in the paper yesterday. The hedge funds are increasing the money they have on board. And we've heard -- again, anecdotally -- that some of that money is looking to get into this market, and we think that's all good. If I could, just one last question that occurred to me. There was a ruling by a federal judge in a foreclosure situation with a bank reported several days ago that the bank didn't prove sufficiently that they owned the mortgages because of these various tranches and stuff like that. Do you have any comment as to how that might complicate the whole market? And whether or not we are potentially affect by such a ruling? Two questions there. To the extent that would it affect the whole market, my guess on that is those securities that didn't properly have the documentation done are probably fairly minor in the marketplace. I wouldn't think there's a lot of that -- number one.
 And number two, in terms of our case, to the extent that we -- well, we buy our mortgage-backed securities from Wall Street, but the ultimate originators are the major financial institutions, and we have reps and warranties from them, and we have trustees whose responsibility it is to make sure that the proper documentation and ownership is in place. So to the extent that there was a loss as a result of improper documentation, in most cases, we would have the ability to go back against the originator or the trustee to get compensated for that.

It's interesting because music has grown and it has turned, actually, we're very happy with how fast we've been able to turn the music business, especially since there's so much chatter out in the marketplace about music being tough.
  We are looking at the other categories. We certainly have looked at the fashion categories and some of the accessory categories and there has been some shift as we've planned for a leaner inventories in those areas as we support music. I think as music continues to gain momentum we'll probably see a bit more shifting.
  You know, we've got a small store, averaging 1800 square feet and most of the buyers know they have to earn their spot on the floor. So if music continues to ramp up at this pace, I think we'll continue to see more of a mix shift toward the music areas.

We feel good about the inventory control process that's been put in place and our ability to control the level of promotional activities in the stores.

There's a number of existing hedge fund platforms. We haven't brought in material amounts of third-party management groups here, although we've got one in particular which we're excited about on the commodity side, going to launch a new product around that.

Now, that may be an issue that will create some problems for certain of the owners and certain of the yards.
 The yards are being squeezed by higher steel prices. We see now that Nippon steel increased $189 per ton the steel plate that they sell to the yards, so the yard margins have been squeezed and they are complaining. Of course there are still huge margins because they -- for the yard, but they are going to be squeezed from both sides. First of all, they need capital expenditures to develop the green yards. Second, they need additional credit which is not existing to get -- for certain of the yards. And third, their margins have been squeezed. So we do see some possible issues being developed there.
 Tell you the truth, I expect most of the vessels -- we do not want to be more optimistic than necessary, I always take into account that just about all the vessels will be built that have been ordered or most of them, at least. What we might see some delays, that I could say I could expect. But I would not get my hopes up too high. I think most of the ships will be delivered that have been ordered. But at that the same time, even if let's say some delays around forward on some deliveries, I think we're going to have kind of a positive effect, meaning that if you have quantity the divided by in two year time, 2010 and 2011, and the same quantity with the rollovers being delivered and divided within a 2.5 or three-year timeframe. Maybe that the pressure from that extra capacity coming in is going to be a little bit more normalized, therefore we will have a rather -- somewhat positive effect on the flow within the certain time of period. So we are going to see that. I wanted to mention a number. The greenfield yards are about 11% of the Chinese yards. The whole -- the ones that have at least, on a tonnage basis, the orderbook that has gone to the green yards is about 11%.

1822835_T,1,{52},"Sure, Michael. As far as the promotional hotels go, it's hard to tell, but we think that the effect on the bottom line is essentially neutral. And I think you kind of see it in Q1. To the effect that were getting promotional inventory from the hotels, because of our margin structure, because we get a cut of the transaction, we make less per transaction just like the hotel makes less per transaction. So we are promoting along with the hotel.
  So, that transaction is less profitable, but you do see it driving transaction growth. So for example, if you look in Q1, we had a higher growth rate in merchant hotel rooms than we've had in, I think, two, three years. So you saw an acceleration of merchant hotel room night growth, but a decrease in revenue per room night. And that is exactly what we would expect to see in call it a promotional environment.
  So I think on a net-net basis, the two cancel out. Now rate is higher margin. If you get a big rate on a hotel, there are essentially no costs associated with that. So to the extent that you are making up rate with volume, there are costs associated with that, customer service costs, fulfillment costs. So maybe it might be a slight negative as far as call it the bottom line goes.
  On Europe on hotel tenuring, I think the way we view it is we want our growth rates in Europe to grow consistently with our hotel inventory. And if you look at the last year, the growth rates in Europe exceeded the growth and the number of hotels that we have in play. So just doing the math on that, you would expect that the sales per hotel would be increasing.

Based on the CSA we have the choice either to have less capital needed through the reduction of the risk weighted commitments or core capital.
 And the definition of that core capital is easy. It is core capital defined by the Dutch regulator. So we will only accept strong core capital and thus will certainly not make any issue for our capital raising exercise.
 You rightfully mentioned the delta of EUR900m, mainly due to the fact that the equity valuation -- valuation of our equity portfolios in the accounts of Fortis is volatile. So that will move up and down during the next coming years.
 You will remember that on March 9 we had in fact two major buckets in the financing plan of Fortis. The first one mentions the EUR1.6b on that date was about selling assets and this is still going on. We highlighted, we defined some assets at that time being mainly asset management activities that were not included in the Fortis Ping An activity and some other smaller assets that are not needed anymore in our portfolio due to the acquisition of ABN Amro.
 And then there was another bucket of EUR2.5b that we qualified as being the ability to raise non-dilutive capital in order to either cover unexpected volatility in our accounts, or even expected volatility like for example the impact of the equity portfolio valuation. Or even creating some room for the business in 2008 or more probably in 2009 to grow at more than the expected or decided 10%. So the non-innovative hybrid instrument that we expect to launch in the coming days is part of the EUR2.5b.
 You will probably remember that we did an exercise in February for $750m. We call that NITSH, it was a deeply subordinated special bonds. That's the type of instrument that since we did it in February a number of our competitors also launched in Europe.

1881625_T,1,{85},"I think one of the things that's important to say, Edwin, is we recognize there is two main levers that comes into focus. One is gross profit, and one is operating expenses. From a gross profit standpoint, I think you guys will now begin to really see the impact of some of the steps and actions we've taken over the past twelve to eighteen months, and specifically the impact of the fab change and so forth.
  And you'll also begin to see the impact I think next year of the move to, one, utilizing our existing fabs at a very high utilization and then utilizing outside foundry for all the production requirements above that. And so I think that's one of the reasons that as I talk about 2009 I expect to see gross margin continue to improve for us, because we'll be at that point be getting lower cost wafers from our existing facilities, as well as getting lower cost wafers from foundry. And we've actually put in place some programs in our existing fabs to raise the productivity there as well, which will give us a lower cost as well.
  So I think one of the things we'll see is you'll see continued gross profit improvement I think not just this year, but throughout 2009, and beyond by the way.
  Secondly, because [as we] finish that, we have as a target as a Company 45% gross margin. And that's not something that we're saying we're going to take forever to get there. It is something we take seriously here.

  Although when you think about our overall restructuring program, the biggest supply chain benefits are the ones you have to comp because they were major infrastructural changes.

And I think more importantly, I think it gives us a chance to sit down with our contract partners across both networks on the regional jet front and talk about how we can do business more effectively together and more efficiently together, because there's a lot of redundancy and a lot of cost to operating as many contracts as both we and Northwest do.

And then the remaining group of lenders, headed by [Vince Daley] who is very experienced lender, are focusing on the remaining portfolio to try to make sure that they do not slide further into the problem zone.

 So, depending upon the actual timing of when we're inaugurating a new partnership and bringing on enterprise customers versus a ramping up, say, of a migration or an acceleration of DIY customers, those two could offset, or there could be an imbalance one way or the other.

They are weathering a pretty severe storm up there, and the smaller businesses are struggling to stay competitive. And as far as our acquisitions strategy, right now I would not say this company is going to deploy capital to buy up these businesses. And there's a couple reasons for that. They are hanging on, but it is a very unionized operation or state, and there is an unfunded liability, a pension liability tied to a lot of these small companies that this company won't want to step into. So, unless that can be contractually ringfenced, then we will just try to out-compete them within our marketplace and -- but we will, we are looking at a lot of different ideas with this joint venture to grow our position and continue to be more competitive than our competition. And yes, we are in the process of fleet reduction significantly in that market, and also curtailing our plants for a period of time. We have a number of plants that we're not operating right now, to reduce our fixed cost and trying to deliver concrete and maintain our market by going further out and not operating a number of plants. So there's a big initiative within the Company to try to control our costs in a very tough environment. Yes, if I could just follow up on that. I think Robert mentioned in his comments that we have already, we've not purchased any new mixer trucks this year and we've actually disposed of 100 out of our fleet, and we've got 80 on the shelf to be auctioned off. So, we're taking trucks out of the market, we're mothballing plants, and that is happening in virtually every market with the exception of West Texas, where we're -- we can be more profitable by closing plants and serving those customers out of a smaller plant network right now. And that obviously has an effect on head count and number of loaders that you have. It just has a ripple effect throughout the organization, and those are the cost control measures that we began to put in place. Frankly, we started this back in January and it just continues on, and we continue to evaluate every market on a real time basis to make sure that the demand supports the assets that we have there, and we will take steps to right size this thing to maximize our cash flow, and there's more we can do. You do get to a point in a market where, and particularly in an urban market where if you close a particular plant, you're basically retreating from that area and you're unable to serve volume in there. And so, you have to do a pretty detailed calculation of how much fixed cost is that revenue covering, and what is -- what impact does not being able to serve customers in that particular market segment have on your overall market position.

  With respect to West Elm, first of all, just our comps for the year are low to mid single digits down. But when we look at the -- and we've got some stores in there that we did early on that we know were bad, not the best locations for us, not the best choices for us. So those are having an adverse effect. I'm getting a lot of information here. Those are having an adverse effect on us. And then, of course, in Florida, which is one of the places that's really been hit, particularly South Florida, where we have three now really strong stores for us that were very big volume stores for West Elm. They've been hurt down there more than the norm and so that's had a big impact on us.
  On the stores that we're watching, where we now have kind of zeroed in and learned from our real estate learnings, really, over the past four, five years of opening these stores, we're particularly pleased with those stores. I mean, our Chelsea store in New York is phenomenal. Really, there's other word for it. And it's growing every year. We'll be opening a second store in Manhattan in the spring. So up on Broadway near the Time Warner building, across the street there. And in our stores, like Dallas and various locations around the country that come to me, we're doing very well.

We do not believe once again that the benefits seen in Q1 will last for the remaining nine months. Part of this is also trying to predict what FX rates are for the last nine months and who -- I don't have that crystal ball here today.
  In regards to your last question around the bottom line impact, what we've stated is that if you look at on the slide, constant rates, we had 19% improvement in operating income. And I think there was a previous question were we've said if you look at the total growth at the bottom line, about half of that you could attribute to FX benefit. I'd say that puts you somewhere in the right ballpark. Roopesh, another way to think of FX, if in fact as you suggest we're in a scenario where rates stay where they are, essentially you would never have a negative impact coming from the foreign inventories of international inventories. What you would see is the benefit that we had to cost of sales this quarter, would go down rather quickly and then essentially stay at zero. Okay?
  The other piece, then, is the FX impact on our international income or margins. That piece as you would expect, as you would have seen also in the top line results was actually negative in Q1. And based on current rates if we were to stay here, you would probably have a relatively similar impact in Q2 and Q3 before it would moderate pretty substantially in Q4 based on how quickly rates move in the last part of the last year.

And lastly, I think the question was the maintenance cap ex. Our CapEx is about $140 million for this year. I would say the maintenance CapEx is probably about $125 million. We're a little bit above that this year, because of some of the spend on our business transformation program. But we expect 140, in the neighborhood of 140 next year, about 140 next year.

The question you asked is a very difficult one. The situation internally is that we are implementing various measures under these circumstances. Marketwise, it may sound stale but lower share prices is a negative factor and tax cuts is a positive factor. The issue is land prices. When land prices fall, it could be a plus sometimes but a minus on other times. It's difficult to guess correctly.
 When share prices fell in 2003, well, it may not tell us much since the size of the fall doesn't compare to the current decline, but in 2003 orders remained very high, and so falling stock prices don't necessarily mean bad experience-wise.

We have a situation here where we hear customers daily calling us to say that credit promises that they thought they had only a week ago is no longer viable, etc., etc. So we cannot say that this present order book is without risk either.

 It's not that it's in the back burner. We just said we are not going to make any acquisitions that would compromise our ability to be competitive in the markets that we are in. That was the real message, okay? We will maintain discipline, particularly in light of the current financial and economic environment.
 In terms of the ramp-up of facilities, we don't really report individual hospital ramp ups. We continue to a see strong volume in a few of those facilities. Some of those have moderated. It's a balance. In fact, our leading growth facility this quarter was not involved in one of the expansion projects.
 As we said before, it is a portfolio business. There are different things that happen in different facilities that may contribute to growth or contribute to the lack of growth in a particular quarter. Balanced all out, we had some facilities a little down, a lot of them pretty flat and some that were fairly nicely up, as it is in every quarter. That hasn't really changed. I'll ask Phil to address some of the issues on UPL, et cetera. On the UPL, Henry, we did get a payment under the Texas UPL program this quarter. The impact to revenue was approximately $12.1 million and the impact on EBITDA was about $6.5 million in the quarter. We would like to emphasize or mention that when you compare that to the prior year quarter, there was no Texas UPL payment.
 However, the State of Arizona under their Medicaid program, has historically made disproportional share payments in the quarter ended September, which we received last year for $4.9 million. We did not receive that in the September quarter this year, but expect to receive the Arizona Medicaid dish in the quarter ended December '08. There's a mismatch on Arizona, and a mismatch on Texas as well. If you look at the two Medicaid programs on more or less a combined basis, we had about $4.9 million in the prior year quarter numbers and about $6.5 in the current year quarter. In regards to SWB, it's hard for us to say it's going to be the exact number. As Phil mentioned, we are very early into a company-wide self-insurance program which does impact the accounting somewhat there. On the flip side of that, as we continue to find the need in our markets to employ more -- particularly primary care physicians. As we have needs in the market, that's going to push SWB in the other direction. We have what I'll call conflicting different agendas there that impact SWB. I would say that will be hard for us to project exactly where that's going to go, depending on when we get stability in our new self-insurance program combined with whatever the ramp-up is on the physician side.",train,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

We think that the growth that we've shown in these distressed properties actually is a good sign and it's shown good growth. Our market is actually doing fairly well in California relative to what's going on out there.
  We still think we can make a lot of improvements in California and we can definitely continue to get better, but we feel like we were a little bit slower in our growth, but relative to what's going on in the rest of the market, in the traditional market, we think we're good.

2009134_T,1,{51},"So, let me describe the history of the last three years, perhaps that makes it easier to understand what's going on. Last year, I was asked to start as a consultant here with the Company, and one of the biggest issues has been the fire, how to reorganize the facility to get it on a certain level, which is our standard in Europe. And we started this May that we reduced everything which is pre-manufacturing in the tool shops to a zero level and outsourced that completely to the local supply chain. We cannot compete against Singaporean high-investive companies who buy hundreds of machines, all the same, and that makes no sense.
 To improve on our cost base, we outsource everything besides the last 20%, that is, the finishing of the tools and also the tool engineering and the application part. So far, for the tooling business, and that's what we have done on the tool shop. The tool shop is completely set up again, but if you look on the machines, we focus on the last 20% of the finishing that is high precision in the sub -- micron area.
 Most of the equipment is below -- or that what we can manufacture is below 10 microns, and that is unique in Asia. And they have, meanwhile, a good stuff who can do tool engineering, who can do the complete management of that and we have a very strong supply chain in Asia where we can force whatever we want. And with this philosophy, you can also go to each place in the world you want. Where you get it cheaper, you go to this place with the pre-manfuactured part.
 On the second side, if you look on the system house, that is, the system integration, we have a clear strategy where we say we focus on manufacturing our machine, but we buy the module, so machine is normally set together out of 30 to 70 modules, and we make the system integration. That is what we can do best, do the software and the application part and that's it. And we have meanwhile settled a lot of people who can do that and also the engineering level is, I would say, from our staff, we have more than 30% engineers.

  And that was at the growth of the Company and the success and double-digit comps in a sense covered up these things, and gave us the air cover not to have to address it.

The discipline, the focus and the relentless pursuit of efficiency and saving money at the back end, those things that are not consumer facing, has given us the encouragement, and the optimism to make the statements we have made today. Pete can get into the specificity of that. I think the 2 to 3, if you remember the last call at Q3, we were talking about the $0.90 to $1.00, and needing 2 to 3 points of positive comps to get into that. I would say it wasn't the $0.90, it was more the middle of the range. That said, it is correct to recognize that we have gone after more cost, than was there at Q3.

So I don't know if you want to add anything, but we have gone after more cost around rearchitecting since we talked to you last at the end of Q3.

  What is muddying the waters for us now and will become clearer in the quarters ahead is that we've had several businesses and several functions and activities that have been largely unprofitable, and therefore those expenses which had existed in terms of salaries and benefits, primarily have made the comp rations unusually high. That's also even been exacerbated, certainly this quarter, when we've exited one of those businesses, the equity business Rob talked about and have taken write-offs associated with that exist, and severance payments, which is all part of the compensation numbers.
  So I would say that with that now behind us in this quarter, as we look toward the fourth quarter of the year what you'll see are beginning to be more rational, not just compensation as a percentage of revenue, but profit margin as well.
  As it related to your comment on impacting the firm's capital for bonus payments in light of what's going on, on Wall Street, the fact of the matter is we currently have several really excellent businesses that are profitable within the firm and it's very important to pay those individuals competitively. And I should add, those businesses are producing excellent profit margins and returns. They're just muddied by some of the excess both overhead that we've reduced coupled with, particularly, an equity business that was unprofitable.
  So it's very important for us to pay our good people in our performing businesses, replace the businesses that are not performing, which we're currently doing, and continue to add profitable businesses with appropriate compensation revenues -- compensation ratios, which I think you'll see with Am Tech. But it's a long winded statement, but we're very cognizant of that metric and as we move forward, I think you're going to see us looking like the best firms in the industry in that regard.

2016386_T,1,"{26,28}","Mr. Hein, I was just going to turn over the third question to Eric when you personally asked me, so I have to take that one. But let me go through the three questions. The -- as we said, we have -- in our contracts with the government in the moment, we have agreed not to pay any dividend in 2009 for 2008 and in 2010 for 2009. In addition, we have -- in those two instruments which have a certain fixed yield, there's also an upside for the issuer that if dividends are paid they are receiving more interest. It might be that from 2010 on there might be an alignment of regular shareholders in receiving dividends and the Soffin in getting a higher payment that will allow us to take decisions at that point in time.
 Dresdner, well, as we said, the transaction with Dresdner is fully well on its way. It was always planned that the transaction cannot close in step one before end of December and/or beginning of January. And until then, of course, Commerzbank has only a contract but no managerial influence over Dresdner, as a solely independently managed bank or a bank that is 100% owned by Allianz. So any questions regarding their position in taking -- participating in the Soffin agreement would be a question that until closing of step one needs to be addressed to Dresdner or Allianz.
 Outlook regarding Q4 and 2009, to be honest, I will not make any statement here. If you had asked me at the end of August what the outlook for September was, I would not have thought that a bank like Lehman would go bust, I would not have thought that Iceland would default. So, I think in the current environment any outlook is probably outdated next day. So, sorry, I can't make a good outlook going forward. As soon as we see it a bit clearer I'm happy to do this, but my feel is that in the moment whoever has done an outlook during the last nine months has been proven wrong. Therefore, the quality of these outlooks in the moment seems to be rather low, anyway. But Mr. Hein, sorry, on the last point, I always said that the economic terms for step one have been signed. The economic terms for step two have been agreed on, but needs to be -- we need to get the valuation packages from the auditors for this extraordinary shareholding. Also, that remains clear.
 And what I said is not that the economic terms are closed, but in terms of legally. Legally, the transaction in terms of taking control is not closed. And therefore, Commerzbank's management cannot make any influence on Dresdner Bank's management until this point of time of legal closing, because that would constitute an antitrust law violation. And therefore, I cannot answer questions what Dresdner will do until this point in time because it's just a law violation if I would do so.

In relation to your question on value added services, the nature of our offering is that we are seeing a significant take up for add on features and services and apps.

  And for the new strategy the Board of Director has recently confirmed, it includes several key things. But I would like to stress, or to dwell on the two of them.
  First of all, indeed, the main task of nowadays for the Company is to transform to a universe, and we call it in Russia, and for our foreign listeners it is obvious to understand, as a single sales provider of comprehensive telecom services. And the main asset is in our new trend will be data transmission services as a key driver.
  As you know, during the past periods Rostelecom has already modernized its nationwide network to be able to offer different kind of services, data transmission services. And our key objective is to increase our market share in this segment, and acquisition of RTComm is a first steps toward this.
  So, the second aspect of our strategy is M&A program. I mean our striving for acquisitions of companies with a certain client base, with a certain market share, in the regions they operate, and with due diligence.
  As for the second question about RTComm.RU, the most part of RTComm.RU revenue is providing services, wholesale Internet services, to other operators. The market share in this segment, we estimate, is 18%.
  If we turn to the third question concerning our CapEx program, it's the same level you mentioned, RUB30 million, RUB35 million -- billion during the coming five years. But it should be mentioned that it doesn't include our separate CapEx for M&A program. During five year period -- coming five year period, it will amount the sum from RUB35 billion up to RUB45 billion.
  And the fourth question, which concerned the changes in margins as for our key performance figures, the last quarter in the year, as a rule, is the worst quarter for this for Rostelecom. We expect OIBDA and OIBDA margin will decrease. But, unfortunately, right now I can't share with you my ideas about the volume of this decrease, because it's up to us to finish the year and we will see. (Spoken in Russian). (Spoken in Russian). (Spoken in Russian). (Interpreted). As for our potential goals for M&A program, indeed, indeed, we see some targeted companies.

We think that we are extraordinarily well positioned because we believe we're the only company that is now actively delivering siRNA systemically. We are the only company, we believe, that is using siRNA for oncology. So to the extent that we see positive results in this clinical trial, we think that we are in a fairly powerful position to enable these other companies to extract value from this potentially revolutionary new field of RNAi. So I will hand it over to Dr. Hamilton to talk about the specifics. Sure. As you probably know, lipasomes have been used, or attempts have been made using lipasomes for quite some time to deliver (inaudible) nucleotides DNA, plasmids or antisense therapeutics, and traditionally, these attempts have not worked. Where we see the advantage of the RONDEL system over lipasomes is several fold. A lot of the lipasomes that folks are trying to use may have some issues with hepatotoxicity. They intend to accumulate in the liver, almost -- if not the entire dose, virtually the entire dose may accumulate in the liver versus accumulate in tumor tissues. This is not the case with the RONDEL system.
  There are issues with loading efficiency. By loading efficiency, I mean how much siRNA one can get into a liposome versus into our system. There are well document issues with aminogicity of lipasomal drugs, problems with multiple dosing and effects of clearing antibodies on lipasomal drugs, and there are also issues that are questionable with regards to internalization of lipasomes, getting lipasomes into the cell and getting the payload inside of the liposomes into the cell. These are all -- of the four issues that I mentioned, are all things that we think that we have made a lot of progress towards overcoming. Thank you, Bill. We have none?

What we have seen in the last month actually or last two months is that on the retail side, on the credit cards, on the consumer portfolio, on the mortgages, what could be seen as a changing trend, we have seen no deterioration. Nevertheless, important to note that July is quite a typical period, because in Peru people received two salaries that month. Thus, there is a certain amount of extra money going in, which is always utilized to pay down debt.
 But my gut feeling is that, we have seen on the retail side consumer, credit cards and mortgages the worst behind us and I expect to stabilize around the levels we are in about July. On the lending -- on the micro-finance side, we have continued seeing a little more deterioration but at a very much slower pace, and there is always a bit of a lack there. Micro-finance response to economic activity, economic activity will start to pick up. We've probably seen the worst.

 In terms of provisioning, we have tried to stay ahead of the curve, meaning that we are always provisioning a little bit extra and not being aggressive in provisioning in case things continue to deteriorate.

So regardless, carrier or not, if there is any ways to use radio wave or MVNO in a better way, then it has to be pursued. That means the fulfillment of duties to the people.

And from the Ministry there was a comment that the license, the number of license is limited. Therefore the operator who are granted with the license have to fulfill the duties to provide the service to MVNO. That was already told by the Ministry.
 So if there would be any rule to limit the carriers to collaborate in MVNO then the benefit for the people will be damaged. So that is not beneficial to the people. So if carriers starts MVNO then that will happen. So that carrier just gives up proactive capital investment.
 At the time when we acquired Vodafone KK the number of base stations was around 20,000. But now we have over 50,000 base stations, which is more than double. And KDDI for the last ten years, they have built up 20 something base stations. But compared to that number we have increased the number of base stations from 20,000 something to 50,000 something for the last two years. So we have been preparing ourselves to provide a good service using radio wave. And we have good performance result. And we also want to contribute in this MVNO field.
 So when the 1.5GHz license is granted to us then we have intention to use it in an efficient way and to share it with [Azaz].
 So that means we are not reluctant to invest in capital or reluctant to do any more CapEx. Well, I understand that there might be some peak once again in terms of the CapEx in the future. But as I just answered the similar question before, we are following our long-term business plan for CapEx. And we are using the reasonable level CapEx. And we are always careful about the efficiency of the CapEx and we are making good efforts for that. And I know therefore is we win collaboration with Emobile and also we win collaboration with fiber optical service. So it's not like we are being stubborn or we are just looking backward. But we try to be proactive, but at the same time we always try to be reasonable at how much we are spending.
 So if we ever either partner KDDI or DoCoMo, because we have already started negotiation with NTT East and NTT West. So it's not like we have been stubborn in management. We do have high ambitions in management. So if we ever change our share, our high ambitions will be good candidate partners for us. That's my policy. Thank you.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

2084891_T,1,{6},"Okay. Regarding net interest margin, what happens is the following. That there are a number of forces coming and interacting. There are some negative forces, one of them being the lower inflation that we're expecting because, as you know, given the asset and liability structure, the bank benefits from a high inflation environment. So that would be negative news, followed by the fact that we're growing in the less risky, less yielding asset categories, mainly high end of the consumer market and large corporations.
 And thirdly, the other factor that will be impacting net interest margin is that growth will be slowing down. So there are three forces that will be reducing the growth rate of net interest margin. And that is partially compensated by two positive factors. One is that spreads are growing worldwide. As you know, in all financial institutions abroad are increasing their spreads and therefore banks in Chile are forced to, because of the higher cost of funds, to increase their spreads as well.
 And secondly, the fact that the Central Bank is expected to start slashing rates quite actively because of the rapid decrease of inflation, will result, given the asset and liability structure, given that our liabilities are much shorter than our assets, then we will have some margin expansion because the repricing of liability is much faster than the repricing of the assets.
 Yes, so because of that, five factors -- three negative, two positive, we will see some deterioration in net interest margin, but probably not as intense as you would expect simply by seeing the overall economic or the growth of the loan book. So there are five forces we believe to take -- at least five forces to take into consideration. So we expect net interest margin to be under pressure and probably going back to more ""normal"" level for net interest margins after followed by the very high levels that we saw in 2008. Yes.
 In terms of loan growth, it will depend on the evolution of the international situation. Yes. We see kind of a window of opportunity because many banks that used to fund Chilean companies now are unable or their charging spreads are very high compared to the ones that were charged 18, 24 months ago. So many companies are coming back to that market. That is an opportunity for the bank that has the liquidity and the strong capital base that we have seen throughout the presentation. If they will start to normalize, and hopefully everybody suspects -- everybody is wishing that will going to happen, probably we'll go back to our medium-term strategy which is basically to increase our penetration in the middle market and in the second 20%, 25% of the working population.
 So it's kind of a window, at least for 2009 or at least until the world is in a sluggish mood. If the world starts growing, probably we might go back. So the mix this year will be biased towards the less risky, less yielding activities and going forward in 2010 it's difficult to know. But depending on the footing of the external economy, we can see a reverse and more growth in individuals in the middle to lower end of the consumer bracket or middle-market companies as was the case in the last three or four years. So we think it's a way to compensate and it's a window of opportunity for 2009 to take advantage of this opportunity in the corporate segment.

2085520_T,1,{29},"(Interpreted). Yes, you are right. You can see the decline of HIFU sales compared to the last quarter or year on year rapidly because -- mainly because the economic downturn. We see the hospitals getting more cautious to purchase large capital equipment. This is not only when they are buying our HIFU system. It's true for the other large medical device suppliers. Multinational companies, it's the same case.
  And the second reason is, some of our dealers, they used to buy our HIFU -- to get the credit from the bank and buy our HIFU and invest the HIFU in the hospitals on a profit-sharing basis. And earlier, the economic downturn, there is a tightening of the credit in the China market and it's getting hard for those dealers to get the bank facilities for -- to finance this kind of business model. So we see a slowing down from -- for the orders from those kind of distributors. So we actually predict this kind of slowdown and it's part of the reasons we decided to sell HIFU business, but it's not the whole reason.
  And another reason is, of course, the HIFU business is not in line with our Company's future direction. We have claimed that our Company's strategic direction for the long term is to become the high-end IVD company in China. Of course, HIFU does not fit very well in our long-term business strategy, so we decided to sell our HIFU business.
  For your question about the future direction for HIFU business, I'd like to add one comment, that Chinese FDA is getting more strict on approving this kind of therapeutic equipment. And they are putting more strict regulations when they approve this kind of therapeutic equipment. So this also affects the prospect of HIFU business.
  The Chinese FDA has officially noticed us that, when we renew our HIFU license, we need -- they need to approve each indication one by one. We have been negotiating with the Chinese FDA on how we can get the renewal of the HIFU approval. And the SFDA noticed us that for -- to get the renewed approval, we need to submit 130 clinical study cases for each indication. In the past, when we got our original approval for HIFU business -- for HIFU system, the SFDA approved a very broad range of indications, including -- so that it can enable us to treat tumors in different parts of the body.
  Now, the new regulations require us to submit the clinical cases for each single indication. This makes it very hard to get this broad approval as before, so that we have to narrow the treatment range. And that in result will push us -- force us to either lower the selling price of the HIFU system or postpone the sales of HIFU system to hospitals, because it is very hard for us to provide so many clinical cases in a short period of time.
  So we predict our HIFU business could decline as much as 50%. And actually, that's also my personal prediction when I decided to purchase HIFU and I actually prepared to have another five years till breakeven for my -- the amount that I paid for purchase the HIFU business.
  So the economic downturn and the more restrictive SFDA regulation are the two major factors that make us to decide to sell HIFU business as soon as possible. What I can tell you is, so far, we haven't got the final renewal approval from the SFDA. We still don't know what kind of renewed approval we can get from SFDA.",test,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

 In parallel to that, we're observing a growth in domestic consumption -- residential consumption. Residential consumption is continuing, mainly because the number of applications using electricity is growing. Each electricity use -- the number of applications is growing up, whereas the quantity of electricity per application [isn't going up]. So, in terms of volume, that will have no effect; just a few percent, maybe 1% to 3% in terms of volume.
 In terms of EBITDA now, that has no effect for us. That will have no effect for us. As you know, we're obliged to buy electricity so it has no negative impact. It has no negative effect. It, paradoxically, even has a slightly positive effect at that level. But if it was to increase it would reduce our receipts but, for now, it has no negative effect.
 Regarding disposals, maybe, I can ask to answer. We have indicated a figure of at least EUR5 billion. We have talked about [sash] disposals, at least, EUR5 billion. We did EUR5.7 billion.

I might add, these savings have been in for the vast majority of those for a couple of months now, and so it's not something we're worried about going forward because we haven't seen any guest satisfaction fall off. Margie, do you have anything to add on that? In addition, we do have approximately $10 million from the closing of our 43 restaurants between rent depreciation and mitigating their losses and in addition on the G&A side some of the reductions in benefits as we've looked at everything in our business, to be as efficient as possible.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

We want to have the best product in every segment. Now if we sell only, let's say, 20% less business class, that doesn't mean we are not anymore a premium carrier in that area. We just have less volume. We are at probably capacity of last year. We were last year also a premium carrier. Even so, the volume was smaller in that area.
 Now if we are growing and growing and growing at the back end, because that demand is also there and we can justify to fill our airplanes, we don't feel that we will be called a non-premium carrier because the airplanes are growing at the back end, which is true all the time. (technical difficulty) but nevertheless on that, you can't get any additional transfer premium traffic from some other [premium] competitors at the moment. And then I saw you have created some provisions for payment rights in '08, and even for the bonus payment for the earnings-related part. Would you share this number with us so we have no additional burden for '09 from this point? With respect to the bonus, I think you have to search for the data. I don't know. (spoken in German) With respect to the other aspect, yes, we do get premium customers from other markets. That's why I'm saying our market share is growing in relative terms to others. But the total market is shrinking. So the name of the game at the moment is get a bigger piece of a smaller cake. That's the way we put it. In terms of variable wage costs, I don't have the answer yet. But it's covered. Pardon me? Yes of course, it's always covered. In our case, in -- we have, as you know, our variable bonuses depend to a large extent on the operating result. But in management, the larger effect comes from the CVA. The CVA, with EUR650m was less than planned. So there we have underperformed our own targets. So therefore, the -- for management, generally speaking, bonuses this year have been significantly lower than they have been last year.
 To the extent that the variable case relates to the operating result, which affects to a certain extent also management, but much more largely other employee groups, there we have, of course, performed well so therefore we will pay for it. But it has all been provisioned. There will be no additional burden from this. I would expect rather a relief to a certain extent. Okay, and then it's really -- sorry, last question. In your internal calculation, how long -- how low can the operating profit in Cargo go? Is there a positive number or is there a red number in your internal calculation? How low can you go? In our internal calculations, of course, we expect them to turn out a profit. If this will be possible, quite frankly, I don't know. It's mathematically and theoretically possible that they will also turn out a loss. Having said this, Cargo has been hit the hardest and was the earliest division to be hit. And we would also expect Cargo to be the first one to pick up the traffic again. So therefore, it really depends on what we do.
 It depends on a number of factors which we can't oversee yet. It depends on the future of Jade Cargo where we utilize the services on a much lower cost base. It depends on the economic growth activity in Asia. There are so many variables. The worst-case scenario for Lufthansa Cargo certainly would also be a loss. But I would not hope that this is what we really expect. Now we come to the next question. Yes, just a question on the decentralized traffic. Isn't the last years, you have focused on the point-to-point traffic on the intra-European routes. What is your experience there? And is it still profitable? And by how much do you expect to reduce capacities there? And do you concentrate on your hubs in the future more than in the past? I think the hubs are naturally more easily to be sustained also in a downturn because you can milk from many smaller markets, rather than if you have a point-to-point traffic in the business segment. So the down-trading is much more evident in the non-hub services and that's why we have to adjust there heavier. But we will not instill any new strategy. We will -- would like to have what we call an omni-directional offer from all major cities out of Germany and also from European cities into our hubs.
 So if you look at our flight plan, no destinations really has taken out except for Bratislava, two or three more small destinations that are of minor nature. But the capacity that has come down is already imminent. And for this year, in total, in terms of seats, we are roughly down 3.5%. (technical difficulty) continental traffic by 3.5% that the hub traffic has been protected to a certain extent, so all of the three, or most part of the 3.5% refer to the non-hub, the de-central routes. And as this part is significantly smaller, the cut rate in those de-central routes, of course, is much higher than overall. Next question from Andrew again.",train,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

And I think that could begin to turn things around here whether it is in May or June or the beginning in the second half. But I think that the inventory levels that they have got and the inventory levels that were reported in the last day or so are extremely low and that really the service centers won't be able to continue to ship at their current rates out of inventory. And so I think the order intake rates are really about at the point where they are going to turn here very soon. There is no question; that is the case as well. We have noted again in the first quarter that the car companies were selling more than they were making. And so I think that the whole supply chain is pretty lean.

The business unit head must know everything about how much cost is necessary for what, so he can calculate everything.
 And in that sense, the decision made as to whether that business should be taken or not is up to the business unit head to make. And all necessary information to make a decision will be reported to the head of the business unit. So I don't think that such a problem would happen. So the capital (inaudible) for the fourth quarter worsened significantly compared with the third quarter. And I think you wanted to know why. And as I explained earlier on, the fourth quarter -- or in the latter half of November, the sales volume started to decrease quite dramatically. In other words, the demand started to shrink. And in the fourth quarter, January to March period, sales volume naturally decreased. Therefore, we put our feet on the brake pedal. For example if sales was 100, we lowered the production to 70 -- to 60.
 With regards to Ball Bearing, for example, these are the actual numbers. In the third quarter, the number was -- the sales volume 150 million in average. This is the monthly sales. And production volume was 160 million. And that is -- those are for the third quarter. And in the fourth quarter, the sales volume was 100 million. Well, the sales was 100 million and sales volume was 80 million. And the capacity is up to 250 million. And sales -- or production volume in March was lowered to 70 million. In other words, one-third of full capacity.
 Therefore, cost of goods increased quite significantly. And the same applies to other products, like spindle motors. In average, sales volume was 2.5 million or 2.4 million but production was only 1.5 million or 1.6 million.
 So for all kinds of products, we reduced production volume. So we were not able to cover all the fixed costs. Due to the increase in cost of goods, the cost ratio expanded. However, we were able to reduce cost of goods quite significantly, or the inventory quite significantly. And the sales volume started to increase once again.
 Of course, we do not know what will happen in the future. Because our customers' inventory adjustment was completed only for short term, the sales volume may be increasing. I don't know if that is true or there may be some other reasons.
 But unlike what happened so far, in April we no longer decreased production volume to the level below the sales volume. Now it is the same or similar level as the sales volume. For example, Ball Bearing in April, I earlier on said 100 million units and now it's back to 130 million units. And the production, 110 million units or 130 million units, we will be producing because we cannot increase the production volume all of a sudden. I think it's going to take three months until we make a recovery. But May will be better than April, and June will be better than May in terms of profitability.
 Spindle motors, 2.5 million units or 2.6 million units is the sales volume and production is now catching up with that number. And the keyboard assembly, 17 million down to 15 million. But in April, it's coming back to the original level. So the production is returning to the original level as well. So the cost is decreasing drastically.
 And headcount reduction in Thailand, I earlier on talked about. And that is creating synergistic effect. And April to June period, compared with the fourth quarter, we will be making significant improvement in terms of cost structure.
 And the outlook for this year, the first half and the second half. In the second half, we shall see a major improvement. Ball Bearing, in the first half, it's -- the production and sales volume are above the projection. And in the second half, probably numbers will become even greater. So production and sales volume should recover to 150 million to 160 million.
 So as sales volume increases, production volume will increase accordingly. So to what extent it can recover? I wanted to talk about the recovery of profit and loss for the month of April. However, we just finished our consecutive holidays in Japan, so we have not aggregated the numbers. But in overseas, we are seeing a major improvement.

  I think the issue for us, the bigger issue is what will the summer look like. And we are beginning to see fares for the summer in the $350 round trip range, which is lower than we would traditionally see. The question is how quickly, how much availability are our competitors providing at that level and how quickly will they fill those seats. We obviously have no crystal ball into that.

And for the organic food it's also very fast growth.
  And I did mention an example in Shanghai. The Shanghai, one city alone, the market scale is about $1b. But that's just 10% of the total consumption in the city.

So for this one, according to our plan, we're going to invest about CNY2m for such a small SDC.

I know the SEC is encouraging companies that have been promoting their probables and possibles in investor presentations to now, in a more organized fashion, put those in their annual report, and encourage them to have third-party engineering review of them.
 But we've never talked about probables and possibles. And the primary reason that we haven't is our capital structure and our distribution model really hasn't permitted a whole lot of booking of and value associated with probables, even though every year we drove probables and substitute probable opportunities and maybe possibles for some opportunities that are considered proved in our reserve reports, just because Paul Horne and his team do a good job of high-grading our capital opportunities and substituting projects that they think offer a higher rate of return than some of our proved projects.
 And a lot of it -- the SEC rules have some very strict definitions around how many locations around an existing producer can be considered PUDs. And that doesn't always dictate what is the best opportunity for deploying our capital. I would want to clarify that I did represent our commodity derivatives position accurately, but I should also remind listeners that we have an interest rate -- a LIBOR interest-rate swap portfolio that ranges in expiry from early 2013 to late 2013, on average about 3.05%. And given the dramatic decrease in interest rates and LIBOR swap rates, that is currently a liability of approximately $11.8 million, and serves as an elevation of our reported interest expense over this quarter, our current quarter that we are in. Because the LIBOR swap rates are at rates that are higher than current one-month LIBOR rates, which are approximately 0.5%.
 So if you are trying to do the math on comparing our stated LIBOR spread compared to what we are reporting as cash interest, you've got to take it into account.

I think that what Dave said is that in this incredibly uncertain time, we're playing this a little cautious. We like to have the revolver drawn and we like that revolver sitting on our balance sheet, until we get real transparency of the fact that the financial markets have come back and have come back to stay.

The -- we had 145 flats in the first development private and we've completed 61. We've got another 14 in lawyers' hands now. You may recall that in May '06 we managed to sell virtually 100% of that development between May '06 and November '06. 75 of those flats were sold in -- to Irish investors, some 20 investors.
 They have been unable to secure anything more than 50% loan to value loans as overseas investors from UK lending institutions in this market. And we have spent some time working with them to try and assist them to come forward, but there is a point at which you need to move on. We are remarketing those properties. As they are all individuals it remains our right, if we make a loss on the May 2006 contract price, to recover that loss from them. They are professional investors though.
 We have two -- we had two other investors in that block as well, one with 12 apartments, one with 30. We've so far completed about three or four of those on one particular investor but, again, we have decided to undertake development -- the marketing ourselves. We've forfeited a 10% deposit on one and a 15 -- 17.5% deposit on another and are marketing those properties. I suspect in relation to those as they are corporate vehicles that the likelihood is we will struggle to recover any loss on resale. But we are currently selling in that building at about May '06 values in any event. Surely there are some more questions. Hi, Becky. A rather boring question, but I was just wondering about capitalization of interest. Is that something you can continue to do even as values are falling? We have continued to capitalize interest. It requires that we continue to progress our schemes and that includes, for example, securing detailed planning consents, putting infrastructure into the projects as well as actual construction. Therefore, the majority of the capitalized interest ongoing in the near term is going to relate to those former activities rather than construction. Ultimately over time, if the construction program doesn't restart, that number will come under pressure. Could you update us on where you are now with delivery of the Wembley retail portion? Yes. We have nearly 1m square feet of retail and leisure at Wembley. We spent, you will recall, approximately a year working with Land Securities on that, which fundamentally underwrote the concept of what we were trying to do, all the designs. And but in I think, October we agreed with Land Securities that the market was not one that we should be moving ahead with in the short term at the very least.
 We have a moral obligation to return to that process but, in the meantime, I think we're looking at simplification. So in my talk I spoke about the designer outlet center as one part to get that away with the cinema. It's a 150,000 feet plus the cinema, with 700 plus car parking spaces at surface, and that's what we're working on to get that one away as the key place making experiential element.
 So we will need to go in for an amendment on the planning over the next six months to take off the residential above that. And so that's the way that we're going to go with that. It is a far smaller undertaking. I suspect that there was in 2007 -- at the height of the market there was a prospect of a 500,000 square foot retail, plus 1,000 apartments above, but in this market that's too big a deal for the lending market to accept. But the designer outlet light solution is ultimately very easily deliverable and that's why we're going with it now. Any more questions? Down here. Hi. One question. Because you published a discount rate of 15.5%, is it also possible that you would give more details on the development pipeline? Because I think it's very important that if projects get moved out, that must have a more important impact in the value. Because I think it's very difficult to -- for us to get a good view on what will be delivered when. Is there a possibility that you could publish your whole pipeline? We have already shifted out, and it's taken into account in the financial model, at least an entire year's worth of delay into the project from the March 31 date. So far as the pipeline is concerned, we're -- the next element will be in the south of Greenwich, the designer outlet, the lighter version of the Hilton Hotel, the supermarket on the southern land -- southern part of the site.
 It's quite a flexible beast to actually deliver a pipeline bearing in mind market and the requirement for us to have joint venture partners on and/or we will just merely do land sell. So the discount rate is a blend of expectation of land sales or joint ventures and/or, in principle, development. Which is a non-answer to your question, I accept, but there is a very significant element of delay that's already been factored into before the discount rate has been attached to the site. But do you have one valuer for that or you do you have different operations? There's one valuer for that. But it's also the discount rate and the impact of the timeline is one of a number of major factors which ultimately overall affect the impact of the discounted cash flow. It is worth remembering as well that when the valuer looks at the asset he has to do a stand back view and say, regardless of any model, what is this site worth on commonsense tests of per acreage value and things like that. And I think that that helps provide some foundation to their views on the valuation. But you don't want to publish that one? We don't mind publishing it. It's just that it will change every year as life moves on. I understand, but at least I think it gives a lot of transparency if it will change. It's difficult to be transparent in an obvious and certain way. We used the analogy earlier of my old boss who said you drive the car according to the road. We've outlined a program for cash retention and preservation. We've outlined -- we've said that we are seeking joint venture partners.
 It would be imprudent until the shape of this recession was better known, the credit market started to open up and the institutions started to buy again and hopefully get involved with forward committing to over commit on development. At the same time there's an awful low we can do, and are doing to make progress on site. So therefore to do a pipeline -- maybe I'm missing the point. But it would be very difficult to do that and, arguably, imprudent until we had a better view of the next 12 or 18 months. Because the last thing we're going to do is to start spending money where we don't have to. Okay, thanks. So what's the current view on raising equity? You were talking about different options but, given the tightness in LTV covenants, what's the current view of potentially coming and looking for capital raising? As hopefully demonstrated today, the management team are highly motivated by a plan of self help which includes, as we've set out, cash repatriation, cost reduction. We've renegotiated our gearing covenants. But until we are clear about the shape of the recession we -- it is incumbent upon us to keep all of these options under review. Any more? What other initiatives is QFM looking at at the moment? Other funds possibly, or --? Well, it's a market that has a lot of opportunity. It isn't out there, isn't it? Wembley and Greenwich themselves provide opportunities for the delivery of product which would be suitable for funds. Whether that is student accommodation, which is Wembley and Greenwich, hotels or, indeed, residential which is something which is obviously a topic in the news at the moment.
 There's a lot of opportunity in the healthcare markets and student accommodation markets alone. And at the moment we're very much focusing on sticking to the knitting and growing those businesses and delivering performance and not overstretching ourselves and our own capabilities in terms of taking them forward at the moment. One -- I'm going to ask you guys a question. For those of you that represent institutional investors, one of the things that may happen err too long, and there's a lot of talk about it but as far as I can see not a lot of action is funds in residential. London, as I said, needs 40,000 homes a year. The HCA are involved with trying to bring forward affordable and social housing. The buy to let market is in a very difficult place and it may be that, err too long, we will have a residential platform of residential to rent.
 The other thing about that, it enables you to arguably animate the sites more quickly. And it also means that if you can get a decent return on capital employed, because London will come out of this at some stage, then you can actually capture more growth than you would otherwise by selling earlier on in the cycle.
 I don't if anybody in the audience is actually actively involved with residential funds. No? But there's a lot of talk about it, as everybody knows. I don't know if you've got anything to say on it Nick, have you? Well, the fundamental issue about institutional money going into rented accommodation is that where can they get the management critical mass which doesn't actually cost them 3% of their return just managing numerous entities and rental collection and issues like that.
 Where I suspect we can add something different is that we've retained the estates, we own the estates we're managing and we're letting on site. We're vertically integrated with telecommunications and estate agency and lettings of our management will be far cheaper and we can create branded rental product at Greenwich and Wembley. So that an institution can see that, before they need to go into the market, that we have 20 years of pipeline that we can allocate without having to pay stamp duty.
 So it is something that is of fascination to us. Institutions, I think, are holding back because they're waiting for a fiscal assistance from the Chancellor. It was pretty close to being in the budget. Not there yet. And the HCA are committed to assisting but, fundamentally, you need to see the color of the money first as to what sort of underwrite they're going to give. I suspect that it is an additional tool in our locker rather than -- for us going forward
 And we will be renting Wembley substantially pretty soon now because in this market we don't have to dump it out into the market. It is fundamental that we maintain our values and we maintain the quality of the locale. So we're looking after the public realm and the offer generally at Wembley. So if you were building the Rockefeller Center or the Lincoln Center, you'd sell some, you'd rent some, you'd buy in, and that's where our business model will exploit institutional into rent. I have one question. If you were to assume that, going forward, the residential goes in bulk into funds rather than selling them at VP to individual buyers, how would it change the DCF of both projects? I haven't done the numbers, but the point -- I think the point that it would be quite transforming. Because the model -- the previous model for house building in the UK is broken. There is a new paradigm. You're not going to have banks believing that selling 25% off plan with 5% deposits from overseas investors is a bankable prospect. Being able to actually, in partnership, deposit large amounts of stock into an institutional fund who might be buying a significant slug of the building is a transforming opportunity.
 So rather than looking for the market to be transformed by the institutions generally coming into residential, we want an institutional partner ourselves for Wembley. We don't want to participate in other people's funds. We just want to deliver our own product into our own retained funds, managed. And we have the estate management skills in-house already. I think the question is how we get fair value to the rate of return. It seems to me that if, as a result of getting a return on capital employed through a rent, you could defer selling into a soft market to the extent that your -- you've built out (and, as Nick says, you can manage that cycle in a more efficient way) then it should enhance the rate of return rather than anything else. But your -- Because -- but then you've got the trade off between the time, the -- your cost, your profit and the point of sale. So it's, I think, -- put it the other way round. I think the development of a vibrant rental market would be very, very good for us. The ORRs will only be achieved, though, if you consistently recycle some of the product, though. Indeed. And that's where, I suspect, participating with the -- with government and the HCA doesn't work because they'll want it to be akin to affordable housing dedicated for a large number of years. And you've got to have a balance. I saw that in W01 you already rented out a number of units. About 40 or so. How have those been valued in your March valuation? VP or --? Those are ones that have all been rented out for investors so we haven't been renting them out for ourselves. But we will now be entering into rental JVs on W04. That's not in the valuation yet.

We need a better statistical base before we are prepared to do that, it is also a competitive issue obviously, related to this. But there is a premium to conventional, and there is also an operational advantage, as we have talked to, the question is who sits with which part of that equation, or that margin.
 When it comes to pricing play out, we have tied to stick to what we know, what is history, and avoiding being speculative, but I think it very much hinges on whether we as an industry are able to deliver on the capacity reductions.

2309977_T,1,"{67,69,71,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81}","Oh, you mean with respect to the September quarter? I would guess the debookings number will probably go down in September again based upon current business trends. Yes, maybe even the more important statistic is that we shipped ahead of revenue for the first time in eight quarters this quarter, back to our fiscal Q1 2008. So that, again, is a positive indicator. With respect to the shippable backlog number that will go up and down depending on exactly what happens towards the end of the quarter. But there's no doubt that that trended up very, very nicely this quarter and if that continues, that's a good sign. Hi guys. This is [Casey] calling for Mahesh. A couple of quick questions. When do you guys expect capacity buys to come in from DRAM and NAND makers? We don't. I tell you what we don't expect, we don't expect them over the next September quarter or December. We don't think we'll see much. Maybe at the end of December, depending on how the view of the market is we might see some activity there. As I talk to customers in the memory space, they don't anticipate making significant capacity investments the rest of this calendar year. So that's not in any of our models. As I talked earlier, that is really the swing factor in what kind of calendar 2010 year the industry has in general. So I'd say not for the next couple of quarters but assuming a normal economic kind of recovery environment, then we see them starting in the calendar 2010. Okay. During the NAND transition to 3X, can you talk a little bit about process control challenges? Yes, sure, I think there are a number of challenges. In that case, people are really pushing design rules harder than in any other technology node. From that perspective alone, there are certain defect types that our customers are really struggling just to find. We have introduced the new brightfield tool, we talked about, for example, at Semicon West last week we talked about it. That we're seeing in R&D that that is providing unique value for customers to find unique defects that will impact them as they go to 3X. In that case, we anticipate demand increasing for our new brightfield, our new darkfield, our new review tool on the defect side and then metrology also is getting pushed pretty hard as well. That's part of our analysis of why we see growth in process control as we move forward.
  New defect types, some are just associated with the structures, but some are just absolute size issues, that there has been no other way to see them and until we get to that node, it hasn't really impacted our customers' yield, but it will at 32 -- I mean the 3X in general. And lastly, in the [RIG] business segment, where are we on the order cycle with the mask shops? Are they ordering to -- in anticipation of tech upgrades? I think there's been some activity. We talked about in the mask world that March was a reasonable percentage of overall bookings, about 17%. It dropped a little in June but we anticipate it popping back up in September. Our new technology needs, but also we have some new product capability we're bringing to the market and there's a strong interest in that from our customers. We just need to work through finishing and delivering those early tools. But it is driven on new capability, new technology and as we look forward we expect that the reticle shops, the mask shops will renew their investment which frankly they took several quarters of very low investment as they just didn't see the needs from a capacity or technology standpoint, but we're at a position now where we've had new capability and they've got some new challenges. Okay, thanks a lot guys. Thank you. I want to make one final comment for our fiscal 2009. This is certainly a challenging year and we know that it won't be the last time the semiconductor industry suffers a downturn. 2009 for us was a year that allowed us to demonstrate the strength of our technology and our people. In the face of what may well be the steepest industry downturn, KLA-Tencor earned a non-GAAP operating profit in FY 2009 and we generated about $200 million in cash flow from operation. We fully paid our dividend and we built upon our market leadership. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our employees, our customers and our suppliers for supporting us. We're certainly looking forward to a better fiscal 2010. Thank you all.",test,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
2310044_T,1,"{23,24}","Sure. I think one of the things that people have asked about is just the business in general, and I think Rick's comments and my comments, both of us, there was no question that all of this churn between net app and EMC and data main caused customers to think about what they were doing. We feel like we're kind of through that now. Our month of July on the disk has been very strong. We've had a couple of deals that were greater than $1 million that have already closed and shipped. Those deals probably would have been EMC deals beforehand. Now the customer is buying those products from us. And so we think that piece of the market is improving for us.
  Remember, too, that we launched the DXi 7500, and we launched it simultaneously with EMC. They have been a great partner. We think they are the best channel for that large-scale type of product. I don't think they are going to be easy to replace at all in that space, but I do think the new mid-range product that we are coming out with is going to be great for our branded channel.
  And then we're in discussions with the group of people who don't really have dedup solutions about how to use our software, primarily our software not hardware, around their particular hardware offering. And I can tell you everybody knows where we are, and we're having dialogue with many of those entities, and some of them are further along than others. Rick might want to add to that. I would just comment that we are, first and foremost, very clear that we have to build our branded business, and it's important to recognize that our 7500 is highly configurable, scales to large implementations. It requires a consultive approach. That's why it was very well suited for EMC. In the near term, we are going to do that ourselves. We have an installed base, we have technical infrastructure in the field. As John mentioned, we're starting to win some of those deals, some of which we've been working on for quite awhile. Because those are long, consultive processes, we feel good about the potential there, but with our size, there's only so much of that business you can get.
  And so we think the second part of our strategy, which is our mid-range channel-based higher velocity NAS product, is really the biggest opportunity we have. And we're very, very focused own that and have been for a year. It's not like the EMC announcement changed a lot there. We recognize the need to build that segment of the business for a long, long time, and we've been very focused on doing that.
  So those are -- so the two opportunities, first to take the current product and go after those consultive deals more aggressively, not partnering with EMC. Secondly, it's to introduce the mid-range product around the velocity part of the business by engaging the channel; it a little bit off kilter today because of this announcement, the acquisition. And then thirdly is to find the right partner to reach other segments that we want to get to. So that what we're engaged in. As John mentioned, there are a lot of people who want to talk about it. We have to find and optimize it in a way that gives us incremental revenue opportunity, and does so without distracting us from those first two objectives. From an engineering execution perspective as well, we can only do so many things.
  But I would reinforce the fact that it's just so early still. We did some recent data that the percent of customers that have adopted dedup in our base is very small, it is less than 20%. So that opportunity for growth, that's why there's the three times growth over the next several years; very, very positive. And then all of the other companies that don't have solutions do represent opportunities that we're going to focus on.
  So I think our world has changed, our message is different, and we're responding to that, and believe that there's still so much opportunity in this market that the most important thing for us is to move very quickly, embracing the new reality and building on the work that we had already started.",test,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

So it's a combination all three of those factors, a lot of it depends on how the world unfolds right now. It's a-- China is setting records with their imports, it's been supportive prices and we certainly hope that the western world's economies recover, if they do, we're going to be in the position of generating a lot of cash and we'll be able to probably execute on all three of those objectives.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

We can keep borrowing them out until April of 2011. However, under US GAAP, under accounting rules, because every time you roll over a LIBOR loan you are recertifying your reps and warranties.

So in terms of what is going on in the realtor.com marketplace, we don't talk about go-forward trends, but I think what you are seeing just from looking back in terms of what is happening on the Realtor side, is there has been a very large, a significant decrease in the number of realtors out there.

So in terms of the percentage impact to our revenue, it is less than the impact of the number of realtors that are being -- that are leaving the industry.

2327513_T,1,{3},"Sure. Let me take a shot at that, Chris. I think this recovery will unfold in a similar manner, maybe not at the same extremes, but at a similar manner to prior cycles. I think what we typically see is transient business returning first, as businesses free up people to travel to meet with their clients and then ultimately pursue new business opportunities. I think we then later on, probably in later in 2010 and into 2011, we begin to see a significant amount of our group meetings come back, corporations begin to have those deferred meetings rescheduled and then certainly later in the cycle, maybe three or four years down the road, you begin to see some of those incentive travel meetings come back. I think from an ADR perspective, I think the industry will be under pressure through next year, although at a decreasing rate. Particularly as we see typically higher rated business travel return next year, which will be higher than the average rate in the portfolio.
  So while we'll see some pricing pressure both on our corporate accounts and from a competitive position for groups, I think that will be partially offset by an improvement in mix as the year goes on next year. I think we believe that demand will -- we'll see a meaningful recovery in demand next year. We've seen very significant decline in demand, certainly unprecedented decline in demand this year, and I think we'll see a meaningful amount of that come back next year which will help offset some of the rate decline and certainly the small amount of supply that we see next year.
  I think from market to market it's going to vary dramatically. Part of it will be impacted, Chris, by supply growth, so perhaps a market like New York that's seeing significant supply growth this year and next year will be slower to recover. Perhaps a market like Chicago which is so meeting-dependent, will be slower to recover than some of the markets that are perhaps more transient oriented.

  If you look at where we are versus our competition on both switching and routing, I'm very comfortable with where we are. First, you start from a structural point of view. We've reorganized engineering and evolved it, I think, pretty smoothly into one group owning the service provider and the routing products, another group owning the vast majority of our switching products. Within the area, net owning the consumer as well as the chief strategy officer role, Kathy, the central organization, Martin the new emerging technologies. And candidly, that's playing out very well.
  As we did that first in the service provider/routing segment, you begin to see our positions in the industry and our product architectures tied very tightly together. And, as I alluded to earlier, with the key products with both the CRS success, but also how our ASR-1000 products and the 9000 are playing out, and it's always possible I get surprised, but I think we are going to get an increasing share of our wallet spends of our customers in the routing area over the -- as you look into Q1, Q2 and Q3.
  In switching, I think we are doing well, especially in the data center. And Rob, I'm going to ask you to comment maybe about data center overall a little bit here in a second. But if you watch us where we are in terms of the Nexus 7000 tying very tightly to the Nexus 5000, tying very tightly to the Nexus 2000, tying that to our strategy in terms of the server integrated communications solutions, etc., we saw both very good business results and, candidly, I feel very, very good about where we are on these individual products.
  In terms of specific comments about key competitors, I think we are doing extremely well in our channel programs, and candidly it's something that we enjoy a good competitor in. But if you watch what we are doing on the channels, we are not only holding our own. I think in most of the surveys that have come out, when they talk about where we are in terms of gaining share in the data center and in the architectural play, and server technologies, etc., they are saying the odds on us being successful are very high. And they have been pretty candid; they think that that's much higher than our peers' ability to come into our traditional market.
  We have a lot of respect for large peers. They are very, very good in the marketplace, but we are more than holding our own both on the competitive landscape as well as the channels.
  Rob, expanding that into the data center, a little bit your thoughts? Sure, John. In addition to our traditional very strong market position with of the Catalyst product, 6K and 4K, our security and applications, our new portfolio is doing very well. We had a record quarter with the Nexus 7000, which is our core data center switch. And, interestingly enough, market acceptance is high in all market segments -- commercial, enterprise and service provider. We already mentioned that 5K and 2K combination of unified fabric and fabric extension approaching 1000 customers with that technology. The 1K received its first orders this quarter, which is our virtual machine soft switch, and that's off to a good start. And then we are beginning to see, obviously in the latter half of this quarter, our first orders for Unified Computing. Over the next several quarters we'll be increasing the availability of that technology across more markets. We'll be introducing, in addition to our current blade model, a series of new rack models. And I think our real opportunity there is the architecture is resonating with customers, with our partners, the systems integrators and with service providers. And I think the next couple of quarters is all about execution. So time will tell, but we are seeing very good market acceptance on our data center portfolio.

But what we can tell you is that, first and foremost, it starts with the [kilo], increasing the kilo capacity in Norway, which we had already had planned to do for the European market, but which we have increased much faster the cost of the U.S. situation.
  So what we have done is actually open up bottlenecks and we also put in some extra capacity to -- a little bit on new equipment which has been moved from other places in the Group. When it comes to the U.S. investments, we are all based in Miami. We had quite a big space, which we could use, which we have renovated and upgraded.
  And we have then moved equipment from our Chilean operations and used our Chilean team to help set up this production unit. So it's very limited costs that we have spent, but of course it also takes something to open up the supply chain and to transport and so forth. And we are then looking at different options which we tested out, which actually we believe they are coming to good rates. We've used [bigger] capacity on the bigger airlines, which has been freed up because of their problems. And in addition, we have these shorter flights which we also have tested out. That was the answer to the first question and the second one ... The prices have come through. Yes, the prices that has come through -- if the prices have come through to the consumers in Europe. If you look at the prices, you can see that they have, of course, gone up much more in NOKs than in euro. And of course, they haven't gone through completely to the market in Europe yet because of partly fixed contracts and also the relationship is in euro and NOKs during the quarter.
  We have seen some increase in prices and we also have renegotiated some of our contracts, so see some increase in the time to come. With the higher volumes with an increase of 1% and extremely high prices in Europe, I think that we actually can repeat that we think it has shown that the market is actually quite stable. Okay.

And it's different in different geographies being more dramatic than others and sometimes, quite frankly, it's surprising us.
  There's also the issue, and for some reason, year-to-year, you see some variation. It has to do with both how the patients decide to spend their summers and how urologists decide to take off time.

So as to avoid pulling the rug out from under clients and brokers, it will likely take us two renewal cycles to get the portfolios to exactly the shape we like, but we'll certainly make significant strides right out of the gate and so rather than comment on what we could accomplish at the 20 or 50 year return period, our preliminary analysis of the IPC portfolio was that there was significant ability to reduce the combined PML of the group by anywhere from 8% to 15% without changing the revenue nor income projections.
  Simply optimizing the portfolio.

2441771_T,1,"{21,22,23}","Yes. Let me say a word about that, and then I'll ask Bob and David to jump in, if they would like to. Probably the yield most represents, again, the reclassification. For a period of time, we had a significant amount of our excess liquidity -- $100 million of our liquidity, I should say, not all excess -- that was put into the AIM fun. We had moved it out of the Federal Reserve into the AIM fund.
  And that particular AIM fund was giving us a yield of a few basis points higher than we otherwise would have gotten. The AIM fund is classified in the securities portfolio, so basically it was pulling down the yield. And you can see that yield, if you will look at Q1, I think, or maybe, I think if you look at Q1 and then you look at Q2, and that difference there -- and I don't have the basis points in front of me, but it's fairly significant -- that is primarily driven by the AIM fund.
  And then we began to look at the Federal Reserve and what the Federal Reserve was paying. And I'm looking at the investment securities now. If you look at March of 2009, we were at about a 428 investment yield, dropping to 371 in Q2 2009 and then back up to 421 in Q3 2009.
  Again, the movement into the AIM fund, put it in the securities portfolio, the basis points that we were getting there at the time was -- well, it was a little bit more than 17 basis points now, I think, wasn't it? Yes, when we pulled it out. When we put it in, it was a little bit more than that.
  But recently, it's been about 17 basis points. And then we could get -- Federal Reserve, we get 25 basis points. And again, we were running anywhere from $60 million to $100 million in there before deciding exactly where we were going to place it. And so we took it, then, out of the AIM fund and put it into the Federal Reserve, where we got probably about a 7 or 8 basis point pickup, and that's what you see here. And if you would normalize that June for that AIM fund, that would put it at about a 4.25 yield for securities, which is pretty much in line. Just for information purposes, as you know, we are a multi-bank holding company. We have some state charters, and we have some national charters. And the state charters obviously did not have access into the Fed. So what we simply did is we consolidated all of that as being invested through Simmons First National Bank.",train,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

Rather than make an assumption that the commercial trend was going to go all the way back as we have in the past, we have sort of taken it half the distance back. And so that basically to me explains in the Employer Group segment sort of where we are.
  Now you are right to point out that in group Medicare, we have, over last year, said that we expect 55,000 to 75,000 more members are up, up 65, when this past year, the year we are in now, we only had 15. But again in pricing Medicare, we look at things for that overall 5%. In the guidance pages, you can see that the Employer Group overall is shown as a 1% to 1.5% margin.

Actually according to the US GAAP, if our own converted bond would be converted, then we need to book the cost at the time of the conversion.

That's reflecting us opening less sites than we perhaps have done historically, for example, going back to FY08. I think we see social building back gradually to around 20% of the sales mix, and really beyond that I don't think we can give anything specific.
 Houses and flats, I've already given a split for FY10 that we expect houses to be 55% to 60% of the mix. I think that's going to be a reasonable estimate in terms of FY11.

2459100_T,1,"{36,37,39}","I think there are a couple things going on there, Robin. Number one, clearly where we have less penetrated brands there's an opportunity to continue to grow your business even in a down economic cycle because you can still open new doors and get the growth that way as opposed to having to just sell more units in the same number of doors.
 Emporio Armani, DKNY, Diesel, those have all been -- actually they were our first three licenses, so I wouldn't call it the age of the brands. I would just say the penetration of the brands because they have been around for quite some time.
 The other thing I think that would speak to that is, as we've talked about a couple of times, people are voting for fashion and different materials in things and a lot of the core products have been weaker than the fashion products. And we do have a lot of core in brands such as Armani. So as Kosta mentioned, during holiday we may see a little bit of a reversal in people coming back to the core for gift giving. We don't know, but we're prepared either way.
 We've got great offerings in the fashion area for all of our brands. We have added a lot of fashion merchandise and we still have some great core styling as well. But some of the newer brands certainly have taken off and done very, very well. A lot of that is new door openings, and a lot of it is just great product offerings. It really always comes back to the product. You know, Robin, I would also add with a couple of the brands we're not seeing as good a performance as we historically have. We do believe there are action points we can take that will improve that performance. I would say Diesel is an example where we've really gone after a greater depth of key item strategy, focusing in on the most productive styles. We're already starting to see a positive response there in results.
 In DKNY we've gone back and we've energized the fashion offering. We've really worked hard to get an improvement in there. And our early results in fourth quarter where we've shipped that product are very promising. So just because a brand is mature doesn't mean that we believe we can't get continued growth with it.

We had some capitalized software costs as well of about $150,000, but total CapEx in Q4 is probably going to be between $300,000 and $500,000.

It seems that stocks are not high, but the demand is strong. [Totally] construction continues in China that is the -- disrupting or positive, if I may say, element in this metal consumption.
 And essentially, reality is showing us that copper is strong and that project like Conga that has copper values and gold values and that has the social acceptance if I may say, it is a project that if we develop in the future as Newmont kind of stated it.

2477872_T,1,{27},"Certainly, Sandy, this is Raouf. Yes, it's a very good question and one that we have certainly been probing intensely over the last few weeks to a couple of months or so.
  Our understanding what's going on at China Unicom is the following, that they certainly have a number of initiatives underway. Some certainly in the wireline arena, but obviously a lot in wireless as they continue to deploy 3G, in particular the WCDMA, the global standard for 3G, somewhat in competition with the homebrew standard TD-SCDMA. So that they have, on the one hand, that, don't know what to call it, but the giant distraction for a lack of better term, in the rollout of the 3G wireless infrastructure ongoing at the same time as they're starting to deploy this fiber-to-the-building technology.
  We know that broadband and all its flavors of broadband, particularly [packetized] services, such as voice and other services, is a very high priority of China Unicom. The good thing here is that they have selected the same technology for fiber-to-the-building as China Telecom, meaning GEPON. So the technology is proven, it's deployed now in literally every major province in China. So they are not trying to reinvent the wheel, they're moving forward with technology, equipment, and solutions that already feel proven.
  So there is no technological hurdle for them to jump over. It is just really teething pains associated with the early deployment model. Of the 11 million broadband subscribers they have announced, earlier this year, we believe that they will likely to ship no more than two million, possibly quite a bit less than that. But these numbers are sometimes very difficult to ascertain.
  I think it is fair to say that probably no more than 20% of their deployment has actually happened so far, maybe considerably less than that. So we believe that the best is yet to come with Unicom and it is going to turn on in 2010. Again, we believe it will happen in conjunction with China Telecom in early 2010. We will have both of those firing in parallel.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Will the fourth quarter because the economy, the auto industry, the housing industry, the commercial construction industry has been so low, will it buck the normal trend or not? Well, thanks Dan. That's right. That's true. We don't -- and that's the part we don't know. We worked at it very hard. As you know, we've taken an awful a lot of cost out of the business. We can operate at lower unit volumes, I think that sure will produce better margins. But like yourself, we're somewhat uncertain in the fourth quarter. We have more certainty on the first quarter and even -- probably I would say even in 2010, even though it's further way. Fourth quarter last year was absolutely horrendous, not only for us, for everybody. It just fell off the shelf. And so we're looking at this fourth quarter with a lot of caution. You probably listen to market sentiment as well as any of us. And up until a few weeks ago, I think there was more of a positive sentiment than exists today. It hasn't gone negative, but it's not quite as positive as it was.

When we bought Whistler Cable, we paid a little bit more for that system mostly because of the attributes of that system and (multiple speakers) That's true, Peter.

And having said that, I have to let you know that most of your inquiries and questions would have to be incorporated in our business plan for 2010. And they are still in the process of being formulated and they have to seek final approval from the Board of Directors. So, it's the corporate center and the finance management office that are currently reviewing five to six scenarios at present, that much I can tell you right now. But, I'm afraid again, I'm not able to give you precise numbers regarding this.
  And as for your question concerning the targets for subscribers to the KT's FMC Service, again I'm not able to share with you details on that because that's part of next year's business plan, and it isn't adequate to compare with the ARPU of the mobile phone services. But, with added momentum to the wireless data segment we'd anticipate this to increase going forward.
  Yes, you asked about the potential burden for facilities investment or CapEx with regard to the wireless network. Well, let me tell you that we already made investments in the 35,000 some WiFi zones. There are some that have already been deactivated but we will deactivate that and make additional investments in this direction. But, the WiFi network, unlike your typical telecom network, does not require very granular infrastructures so it won't be that expensive as anticipated by some of you.
  And as for the AP the charge is KRW28,000 and the cost of a smartphone, for example, is nearly KRW1 million, so it's a very small fee that a customer would have to pay and as long as you have subscribed to this service you could have access to WiFi or the internet services free of charge as long as you have this installed into homes. And given the 20 million some broadcast subscribers that we have under our belt this affordable AP will further contribute to the expansion of our broadband and VoIP services and phones that are likely to gain momentum in the market. So, my concluding remark is that, no, it will not pose as a big burden for facilities investment to carry out our FMC business.
  And then you also asked about the depreciation trends. I'm not able to give you the exact figures with a detailed breakdown. Please contact one of our working level staff for the exact numbers. But, I am able to tell you that it's KRW3.2 trillion for '09, which means that we are well under the CapEx guidance that was initially set forth.
  And with regard to the WiBro statement coming from KCC. Yes, we have received comments for corrective action from KCC and, in accordance with their corrective action statements, we will carry out a future investment. Again, for CapEx, as mentioned earlier, that it was KRW3 trillion, so additional requirements will be easily managed with the KRW3 trillion as set forth in our earlier guidance. So, no additional burden that way.
  And you also mentioned that some of our wireless data products overlap with one another. But, we are basically pursuing a 3W strategy in terms of the products. The 3W meaning WiFi, WiBro, and W-CDMA, and we'll go in that order in terms of priority access. WiFi has an advantage of high speed and low rate but, there is on the other hand, a disadvantage of coverage area. So, we'll begin with WiFi initially with the wireless frequencies and then if WiFi isn't easily available we'll then go down the priority list to WiBro and W-CDMA in that order. So, we have this mechanism system in place to separate the traffic when necessary.",train,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE

So there is a complimentary strategy of defending and growing. So that's an opportunity come along. Venezuela is a project that has been there for a while; we think that the potential in Venezuela is fantastic.
 The reserves that not only based on oil and gas in Venezuela will eventually make that country a new Middle East for the region, and we want to be there and want to be a preferred partner for typically for the big event. So, the strategy is that we'll be like the preferred partner in Venezuela being in North Venezuela.
 The Latin America strategy is certainly to be positioned in that and follow the same path, Peru and Bolivia. And COMPERJ is a project that will come eventually. We think that the risks, a commitment already made by President Petrobras that the COMPERJ project will be standing out by 2016.
 We think that there is an opportunity that this project may be phased out, the refining part of this and then if a chemical product is coming in two phases, but this is just a proposition that we've made to Petrobras. We're all concerned that the excess offering of products to the market, impacted the market as it could eventually.
 So to answer you, I think that Braskem as being leader in the region, must be present in our major projects taking them and a complementary [test] for this strategy, waiting to grab an opportunity.

2550064_T,1,{2},"(interpreted). Well, let me just answer those points in turn.
  The first on the partnerships and on our ambitions; let me say that it really is part and parcel of our ambitions and the way we have managed our business. There's no doubt that if we are capable of renegotiating operations similar at the end of '09 with Groupama and Predica we'll try and do those.
  But of course, it's part of the items that lead to these criteria. The transactions of last year really ticked all the boxes -- of the relevant boxes. These were high quality offices, so meeting the first two objectives allowed us to improve our balance sheet structure by reducing the LTV; very attractive financial conditions, because the return on assets of 7% boosted our results and also increased the stock market side.
  So these transactions of course -- I mean we didn't cite them specifically, but it's exactly what we'd like to continue to achieve in 2010 and in the out years. And let me add that strengthening of FdR through capital increase transactions is really part of the history of FdR.
  I recalled at the outset of this presentation that we moved from EUR170 million at the beginning of 2000 to close on EUR10 billion at the end of -- that was done of course through acquisitions, but above all through transactions with both equity and assets.
  The second point on our geographic ambitions; today let's not forget that they key point in the Real Estate sector and in the Offices market; this, is of course, a market that requires a considerable detailed knowledge of the market. We're present in France and in Italy; within those two countries, amongst the finest teams to manage and expand real estate activities. That's why we're present in those two countries.
  We consider that the economic cycle in France -- so, it's our country. obviously we find that France has pretty well resisted the crisis. And Italy, if you look at the European comparisons, also resisted very well in the fact of the crisis. We'll see how FdR will expand after that.
  There's a third country that's part of our core geographic expansion, Germany; Germany, where we're strongly present through our residential business. It's a country that's different on the services real estate market. There are several markets, so it's complicated to be present in each of those segments. We might get there today, but it's not on the agenda for the short-term.
  On the technical front with the price and the pay-out; the price of EUR0.60 that was the price that was agreed for the accounting pay-out that was endorsed by the Board of FdR. It's based on an independent appraisal, based essentially on the average of the latest share prices from the tax. We have to determine a value that will be agreed, and these are issues that need to be agreed by the tax advisors between now and the AGM.

2550727_T,1,"{3,6}","Yes, so we are seeing certain recoveries in our -- a big ease in the financial markets and that has to do with a foreign stimulus and liquidity that is impacting [payrolls]. They will be here with a low demand from dollars. That has changed substantially from what it was in the first half of the year. A dollar that is weaker in international markets and that improves the financial conditions in Argentina.
 And that is showing in reduced interest rates in local currency in the country. And there have been improvements in the prices and of capital depreciation of most of the sovereign debt. So that is relating levels of certainty and confidence, improved confidence for investors in deposits and in other special denominated assets. And with that we are expecting reduced -- reduced levels of interest rates coming forward. And that is always good business for our trade of intermediation.
 Risks? I think that the major risk today is probably the fiscal condition, if there is some deterioration after two years of a severe economic turn down, as in the rest of the world. In Argentina that wasn't that big but still resulted in a growth in expenditures higher than what they were in taxes. And so the very historic and traditional fiscal surplus of the last years is -- has been eroding and still positive but lower than what they were before.
 So that is, that is a question mark if those signs of fiscal deterioration would create certain imbalance in the sovereign financials.

2637652_T,1,"{62,63,64,65}","I have a huge amount of respect for both HP and IBM. HP is clearly a competitor. IBM is a partner and a competitor at times. Rob and I were reviewing the impact that it has had. Remember again, we usually create the demand and fulfill it through partners. I would say our impact when we looked at the numbers was not major at all. We are doing extremely well. And we are also doing very well with our new introduction of new systems integrators and new partners. I think it is just part of normal evolution. It speaks to how key the network is to whether you are doing a cloud strategy, whether you are doing a video strategy, whether you are doing a security strategy, whether you are combining so that any device gets any content, and it is transparent to you where the processes are, the data is stored, the application occurs. Intelligent networks is what makes it go. And that is in part the reason you see us being so successful in service providers.
  We have the same goal: intelligence throughout the network and the ability to route any information from any device to any content and video data or voice. It is a nice way of saying that the shifting competitive landscape, that is when you move into good markets, when your top competitors focus on you, that is a compliment. When Apple brings maybe for the first time that I remember the Flip product on [Phase Net], on one hand I said, tremendous compliment, and I thank Steve for that. And then he whacked us, as I knew he would. But we are more than holding our own there as well.
  We have got our second generation product out, and Ned, maybe in that, just as an example, I am going to ask you to comment about how we're doing in the consumer space as an example where we are facing new competitors we have not seen before and a little bit of update on the home. But we could have the same discussion on security. We could have the same discussion in terms of where we are going in service providers, the same discussion in cloud. The great news is we have a lot of different competitors in each category. The key takeaway is we have a lot of different competitors in each category. We are playing architecturally across them and changing our business models.
  A quick update on consumer where it is something there that we want to see, not counting set-top boxes go from the billion to our stretch goal 3 to 5 to 10. How are we doing, and what kind of grade would you give us so far? Thanks, John. So, as you mentioned, John, in your remarks, we spent some time together at the Consumer Electronics Show at the beginning of January. And I think what we saw at CES was the strategy that we have laid out where we are focused on that intersection of video and networking for consumer experiences is really starting to resonate, not only with consumers -- and we saw that in the numbers and the results this quarter relative to our video products, both the Flip products, as well as the overall video systems products as you talked about. Also, our story resonating strongly with partners, media companies, the service providers and some of the fantastic meetings we had. Our focus is to deliver compelling experiences around personal video, branded video and video communications for consumers, and we feel very good about how that is playing out right now. The exciting part is we started each of these market adjacencies, and very few people I think both inside and outside the Company understood how sports and entertainment ties to music, ties to film, ties to Flip video, ties to the home entertainment capability and the virtual capability, the self-installing capability of any device, any content. And that is clearly the road that Ned has taken us on in terms of the architecture. But each of our groups are now starting to come together on it, and customers get it. That is the exciting thing.
  So we will see if it plays out as well as we think. This is a new arena for us, and I'm sure we are going to do some things brilliantly, and then we are going to probably make some mistakes. If we knew what the mistakes are, we would not make them. But I feel very good with where you are taking us, Ned.

We take some of them into account, some of them less into account. It depends on how quickly we think the market will adopt certain solutions. So it's many assumptions embedded into this, so I can't give you specific answer regarding a specific initiative. But overall I think the contribution from new products we usually model it to the low side, because every new product has a cycle -- every product that we sell has a sales cycle of three to six months and if we're talking about a product that wasn't announced yet that means that we will start seeing results third and fourth quarter, it cannot be a huge part of the forecast now. When we're talking the about new industries, new solutions, which I think some of the things were coming up in 2010 are like this we are even a little bit more cautious. And if we have a product which we intend to launch June, for example, most of its results will come in 2011. So we are, I think, a little cautious of that. We have some expectations from existing products that I think making big steps ahead, like the Endpoint, it's just not a brand-new product.

2663140_T,1,{28},"Let me address the second part of that first. On the margin expansion for 2010, we would expect gross margins to be up about 100 basis points, and operating margins to be up a little bit more than that. And from a gross margin stand point, that's going to come from continued productivity on our four-year productivity plan. We expect to see some volume leverage on the business. $950 million to $970 million is a lot more than $830 million that we just finished in 2009. So we'll see some volume leverage throughout the P&L, not just gross margin, but also in the operating expenses. And from an operating expense stand point, we cut a lot of costs throughout the downturn.
  However, we are also looking to continue to invest in certain parts of the business. We'll increase, as Mark said, our R&D expense. We'll increase our advertising. We have here in the short-term, some increase in selling expense, because we have restructured our sales organization a little bit to have better coverage of the stores.

Having said that, I've learned, over my career in this business, that one quarter does not a trend make; that our business in the global economy at certain periods of time is fragile. And that we should make sure that, as we look at our business, we see sustainability and clear signs of that.
  One of the things that concerns me, quite honestly, is I look at employment in large markets around the world. And for example, in the US, we're still seeing unemployment levels that are close to 10%. For me, to really be sound in terms that we're going to have a sustained recovery that is not fragile, I think we need to see an improvement in employment and further improvement in consumer confidence.
  So, again, I think from our perspective, we believe it's prudent to remain cautious. Yes, we did have a good quarter here in Q3. The margin level was very good, helped by some one-time things that don't expect to repeat, as we move forward. And again, I think as -- from an industry perspective, volumes have probably come back than most -- faster than most of our competitors expected. There's probably a lag on the cost as well.
  So, we're going to, as I said, remain cautious. We're going to continue to be aggressive in making sure that we're managing our cost base, our business. And we hope that the trend continues, but we can't take that to the bank yet. There's still a lot of uncertainty.
  With respect to the medium to longer term vision of where our profit numbers, margin numbers will go. I guess the only thing that I can tell you is that, as a company, our objective is to be amongst the leaders in terms of profitability in the automotive industry. And that's how we're looking at ourselves. And as we develop our plans for the business in the medium term to the longer term, we're going to ensure that we're doing the things in order to be able to be in that leadership position from a profitability perspective.
  Yes, we're investing in new technologies. Yes, we're making investment in the electric vehicle. But that does not preclude the objective of being a leader in automotive industry profitability.

About the impairment loss on fixed assets, JPY17.4 billion, I think you were looking for the breakdown in your first question. Here, you see the slide, you see the total here. Looking at the breakdown, one of the factors is the dealer reorganization in Japan. A lot of restructuring entailed impairment loss here. This is one of the factors.
  And another one; here again, this is model-related factor. Some of the models fell short of our initial expectation, and there's an impairment loss entailing this. In both cases, these are a one-time loss.

So, I think Stella and Tangent's business is much more aligned to the Canadian railroads and also to the commercial industry, although they have some Class 1s, so to a certain extent, whether we were competing with Tangent or competing with Stella, it's the same.

That team has been doing very well. Now, mind you, there's a lag effect here.

John Frances, not to name him, essentially as the owner of those units as most of you know on this call.
 The remaining ownership we have to deal with, the context of looking to conversion, we had an opportunity for an exempt transaction or exempt bid. We took advantage of that, in the context of those securities having been cleared at the time of the acquisition through private placement restrictions. So on that basis we bought back 4 million units. In fact we've made a gain of CAD55 million, and that's reflected in contributed surplus, and de facto bought back almost 1% of our flow through a private trade with John Frances.

2734387_T,1,{63},"Thanks, Ben. We are happy for -- I think we are very fortunate we have got some great centers that were in our international trial. They really delivered great results for their patients. It is interesting seeing how different the patients are in a commercial context, particularly if you have a pump that can be placed both on the left and the right side.
  We have -- I am personally looking forward to seeing the cut between our international trial data and our international commercial data because I think it is going to be intriguing to see how much sicker these folks are. For example, some of our BIVADs were put in patients where you put the -- they put the pump on the left side. And then a week later, the right heart just was not responding to either inotropes or temporary support, so they then opened the patient back up and put a pump on the right side.
  Those patients are not likely to do as well as the patients that we have seen in a clinical trial. So I think we will see a much sicker patient population, particularly out of Europe, which suggests that if coming in the door they are worse off, you are probably going to have slightly less good outcomes.
  But I think if you look at, across the board, at similar patients we ought to see similar results. It looks like our device worked well, by most accounts, in our international trial.

 On the other hand, we are increasing our base of assets, our asset base and our result base. And therefore achieving results of growth on a larger and larger base, well it's an objective which is more challenging.
 We are beginning to think that at the beginning of the period we will be able to maintain that objective, but we will evolve towards a rate where the year growth rate is larger than 12%. That's our objective, to go through a first phase which still will follow the growth rate included in the previous plan so that little by little we [work] towards growth rates which are at the level of the objective, which is overcoming 12% a year. Are there no more questions?
 If there are no more questions in the room, we're going to go to the questions that have come from the web. Javier Suarez from UniCredit asks why is the impairment of EUR41.5 million, and if it should be considered [dilutive]? And he says that the tax rate has gone to 28.3%. What is your opinion of the tax rate for 2010?
 The next question is what is the main risk when implementing the investment plan? And he would like to know, what's the weight of the fixed rate debt at the end of the business plan. He also asks about the cost of debt in the period 2010-2014.
 In the scenario after 2014, he asks whether we see the need to make significant investments as a consequence of the increase of international investments and not the development of the electric car. Well, impairment is based strictly in technical criteria accordingly to the accounting international standards and along the lines of the recommendations of our auditors. And as a consequence of the perception of more uncertainty in the international markets and especially what is related to sovereign risks.
 The provisions will depend on the result of future impairment tests that are carried out particularly to the assets of the Group. The international assets of the Group right now, including our share in rent, is approximately EUR105 million after the impairment.
 With respect to the tax rate, our forecast is approximately 30% tax rate for this fiscal year. Because in this fiscal year in 2009, we had an extraordinary element of recovery of tax that we are taking to the Court. So it has an extraordinary limit that we cannot project towards the future.
 Well the risk about our investments, well it's the same. Rather than risks, it's challenges of our investments. The development of investments in infrastructures or linear infrastructures in developed societies, it's a complex matter. We benefit from the effort that we've been carrying out in the last few years, the progress that we've been carrying out in our relationship with the administrations, be it environmental administrations but also sectorial.
 In order to advance in the transactions of our projects, we benefit from the fact that all of the portfolio of our projects that support this EUR4 billion is being processed; all of the portfolio. So we believe that we are ready to make the additional leap in change of investment rate that allows us to go to the EUR800 million.
 So it's not a large jump that we need to make in order to reach our cruising speed which is EUR800 billion. It's not too large a jump that we need to do. And we hope to do it this year so that we can reach our cruising speed as I said.
 Now with respect to the fixed rate debt, well the policy that we follow is to get approximately 75% of our debt at fixed rate. But that depends of course on the market conditions and opportunities. Our policy is to try to have a stability in the cost of our debt in the long-term sense; we're financing assets, long-term assets but also we try to optimize our cost. And therefore we hold part of our debt at variable rate.
 With respect to the cost of debt for 2010-2014 period, I'm going to be cautious because the evolution of the costs of debt, well we would need to see. But we need to be conservative in our plan and we are considering an increase of the interest rates. Especially there is going to be, we believe, an increase at the end of the period. But our investment plan forces a debt increase of EUR1 billion. And additionally, we will have to refinance EUR2 billion more that will increase the cost of our debt depending on the evolution of the market.
 Now with respect to our investments beyond 2014, I believe that we will need to see when we make the plans for 2011-2020, and that we will start to carry out in 2010.
 And this process we believe that will finish in 2011 but it has to do -- rather than with the situation of electricity, it has to do we believe with the structure of energy. With the role that electricity has to play, in the energy system of the next decade.
 Why? Because electricity will be the energy factor which is going to be the key for the next decade. It's a very flexible type of energy. As a technology, it is the factor through which we are going to have all the CO2 free energies, renewable of course. Water, solar or wind energies join our energy system through electricity basically but also other energies which are CO2 free, like nuclear energy.
 Or in the future capturing and storaging CO2 are basically going to use as an energy factor electricity because they cannot carry out the storage and capture CO2 systems with the same distributed system. It has to be centralized. And therefore electricity from the point of view of the availability of energy resources and the compliance of environmental objectives, electricity becomes a key element.
 And if also electricity is adapting more and more to the needs of our developed society because the needs of information knowledge is society, where electricity is used as an energy input as compared to other fuels, there's other primary energies that are used basically. But all of this means that electricity has to play a very important role in the next 10 years, and in the next 20 and 30 years also. And we can see this in the projection of the International Agency of Energy.
 Well, this [we have taken into] (inaudible) the progress and penetration of electric car which is something [where] the development of that. This is allowing to imagine a horizon which is much more closed than what we thought was going to be. And on the one hand, we may replace derivatives of oil, but on the other hand, we improve the efficiency of an electric system with the high penetration of renewable sources of energy.
 Clearly, this supplements electrical systems which is CO2 free. We increase the base demand and we also facilitate the modulation of demand so that we can adapt ourselves better to the variability of the supply.
 So when we do the planning, we foresee that for the 2020 plan, we will have to include the projects for the present plans that are not going to take place, because some of them will have to be postponed, especially those related to the evolution of demand will have to be postponed in time for some years.
 But also we will have to face a challenge for the electrical system which will be much more relevant than what it was in the past. And it is still not included sufficiently in our infrastructure plans that we made in 2007.
 You need to take into account that in that year 2007, we set ourselves an objective for the infrastructure plans for 2010-'16 for wind energy of about 18%. And with the advancement of commitments for 2020, now the government has communicated to the European Commission within the framework of the directive for the compliance of the objective, which is 20% of consumption of energy, all of 20% has to come from renewable sources. And the electricity system has to have more than 40% of its demand coming from renewable energies.
 And in order to get to that 40%, it is foreseen that wind energy has to represent 24%, 25% of the electrical energy in 2020 as compared to 17% or 18% which is what we had set ourselves for our 2016 horizon. So around 40 megawatts of wind, [ground] but also marine. The development of our PV energy at a higher rate or speed than what we had planned ourselves, and the development of solar thermoelectrical energy.
 All of these elements are very demanding from the point of view of the grid. They're very grid demanding so to speak because the flows are very variable that you need to manage. And it's very challenging also from the point of view of the system operation.
 What I mean is that we will need more interconnections and more pumping and more intelligent management of the interaction between grids and consumers.
 All of these elements mean that beyond the situation, our perspective is that the investment effort that the transmission grid in Spain will have to develop in the next 10 years, we will not be able to reduce the investment speed that we are setting ourselves for the next five years. There is another question from Pablo Cuadrado, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who asks if we could tell him the accounting value of the Bolivia business once the provision has been considered. And whether we could give him more detail on the staff growth rate for the period 2010-2014. When he talks about provision he means updating our value on international investments, but if he's asking about the residual value, or rather after provisions in the international business, I believe it is EUR20 million.
 He is also asking for the headcount or staff growth for the 2010-2014 period. There's going to be an 8% growth throughout this five-year period, for the whole five-year period. This is rather a small growth rate. We have a question from Alberto Gandolfi, UBS, and he asks why are we delayed in the negotiations with Endesa for the asset acquisition? We already explained that we don't have a clear idea of what it's going to be, the asset amount, and we want this to be clarified. Monica Girardi from Barclays Bank asks whether we expect any peak in the investments or if we expect them to be flat throughout the period. Well we expect to achieve our cruising speed and then depending on the development of certain projects, there could be certain variations. But we intend to maintain a rather stable cruising speed. Monica Girardi from Barclays Bank asks about the inflation rate considered in the business plan throughout the period. Well we have considered a 2% inflation rate; 1.5% the first year and 2% for the remaining years. [Arturo Lopez] from [NA] Investment would like to know whether, throughout the business plan, we have considered that for the EUR800 million a year, the return on investment would be from 7.5% to 8%. Well yes this is confirmed. We are thinking around those percentages. We have considered a bonus of 4% and with this, our return rate would be around those figures. Fernando Lafuente from Cheuvreux would like to ask, what would be the maximum indebtedness in EBITDA terms after the acquisition of assets? We will be willing to achieve any good agreement, we will be willing to have. Red Electrica is certainly defending this maximum asset acquisition, then afterwards, depending on the value, which is applied to the assets.
 So we will be willing to accept any debt level, then we will have to look to the best financial options depending on the volume and the markets. And Manuel Palomo from Citigroup would like to know whether we would (inaudible) reviewing their payback policy after the EPS policy.

I think actually we kind of back into with the numbers I gave you. So Midstream and Resource would be 190 and ours would be the two thirds. Well, we love talking about the NGL market in the Northeast. And ethane is just one of the products that ultimately will be extracted from that stream. Through our processing and our fractionation capacity up there. The NGL market in the Northeast is very robust. That is why we are building the fractionation facilities so that we can provide the maximum amount of value for those liquids for us and for our producer customers. Ethane just happens to be one of those products.
  It looks to us like that ethane is very economical to extract that ethane and get that ethane to market. That will more than likely be through a pipeline option. There is multiple markets that could be good locations for that ethane . Obviously, driven by the petro chemical demand. So we are evaluating all of those options. But I want to just reinforce the point I made earlier with Michael. And that is that ethane is not a problem in the Marcellus. There is plenty of blending capacity.
  Thank goodness the producers have done such a good job of working with the pipelines to get waivers and get capacity, firm capacity, on those downstream pipelines to get multiple years of blending capabilities for the ethane. Ultimately, we think a producer solution and we hope to participate in that solution for the ethane getting to one of the major markets, whether that is Conway or Sarnia, or Bellevue, or the Gulf Coast.
  Randy, do you want to add to Well, my only - - the only thing I would add - - I obviously agree with everything you said. I would add to that, it's not just the ethane, we think about the other products. We have been there marketing propane for the last 25 years, and the Northeast is kind of our home. So, talking about all the products, there is a lot of value having those products up there in the Northeast. And there is still a lot of markets.
  We're not going to - - I mean the Marcellus, we will have to work very hard for a very, very long time to overrun the market, if you will, in the Northeast. We will be, in another couple months, connected directly to the Tepco pipeline, the largest NGL pipeline supplied to the entire Northeast. Plus, we are able to capture a significant amount of the local market and have rail facility as well. Iso butane, essentially every fractionator in the Northeast is short of Iso butane and wants it all, all year long. We have significant markets for all of the natural gasolines. I think the message really is all the products, particularly the C-3 and heavier products. Propane and heavier products, we have great markets for them right there in the Northeast. We have lots of options for ethane.
  We are fortunate in that acreage dedicated to our plans is where a very, very, very significant amount of the ethane comes to. Whenever you are developing projects, it is always extra nice blessing if you have all of the supply. It puts you in a great place when you are developing projects. So, long-winded answer to what you did in the short version, Frank. But that's what I would add. So, stay tuned on the quote, unquote, ethane pipeline option.

  So we think our performance outlook to 2010, which has been meaningfully advanced, is really a pretty fair reflection and trying to strike an appropriate balance, recognizing that we still have a very troubled economic environment. Employment levels are roughly 10%; 16% if you really get to the true level of unemployment. We are still seeing high levels of attrition.

You're trying to talk about what the stock price should be, and I hope you know that stock price is based on a lot of other things, and we don't have the control over that. All we can do is basically run the Company and the stock price does what it does when it does. Can we find private equity people? Yes, I can find somebody that can pardon my French here, who can screw the shareholders by putting money in CoreCard, it won't raise the stock price but they will benefit. They will benefit significantly in the future and I've chosen not to do that in terms of having the shareholders end up on the short end of the stick, so it's not a good plan in our opinion to take an investment in let's just say again, this is forward-looking, we're just talking here, it's not a good idea in my opinion to take an investment in CoreCard at a $20 million valuation and give a shareholder a participating preferred position, and letting him call the shots because at that point, it's his Company, it's not the shareholders Company and you're not likely to benefit.

Our revenues were pretty much as we expected. The ChemFree made its numbers, CoreCard because of the way we do revenue recognition came in under its number.

We've been told by the auditors now, probably any contract we signed, even though it's for a license, we're not going to be able to count that even when they go live. We're going to spread that over a longer period of time so we will have this deferred revenue coming in so there will be, the stock market doesn't understand that. People don't understand that.

3001392_T,1,{37},"Craig, a couple moving parts. First is that the order book for the outer quarters, Q3 and Q4, is unusually strong right now. And so the thing with -- as you know well, visibility and lead times wind up being inversely proportional, right? When you have great visibility, you have a good order book, but lead times are long and that's an inevitable consequence of booking up your factories. So if you take a look at that, the mix, what's interesting about the pattern today -- so Q3 is more completely booked than I've ever seen it in my years, as is Q4, but interestingly, the mix is the same as we're currently shipping. So if I look at our lead times, they range from single digits, well out into the high teens, depending on the package type and it's always a distribution.
  But it doesn't skew the order pattern. So that gives us a lot of confidence that there's not a lot of speculative ordering. Because typically when you get into the shortage-driven speculative order, it tends to match the lead times and that is not what we're seeing. And so we're seeing our customers' supply chains doing a good job of trying to anticipate what their needs are, and putting a fairly complete set of orders out there to work with. So in terms of the inventory picture, we get weekly, in some cases daily views of the point of sale data, and so we're quite committed and in fact if you look at how we do the ranges, we have for more than a year when we do our estimates, just take a scrub of our point of sale estimates, add that to our OEM schedule and that range is the one that we offer to the investment community.
  So when I look at that, that does have naturally some error bar associated with it. There's no prospect for increasing distribution inventory in that. For the OEM portion, we don't have that visibility. None of the OEMs give their suppliers visibility into what they've got on their shelves, so we have to for that rely on their own inventory reports and so forth.
  But there's no evidence at any level that we can see that there's anything looking like replenishing.

  As it relates to the supply chain initiatives, I think Roger spoke well about the fact that we really maximized some unique conditions in fiscal 2010. In addition to some of the things that we had described probably three quarters ago that we had started in fiscal '09, related to our work with transportation operators that we work with in terms of consolidating shipments and really trying to manage more efficiency into the supply chain -- shifting from air to ocean, and continuing that process, so we really maximized a lot of that opportunity in fiscal 2010.

You know, what we have reflected in our K for future CapEx is the only way I can respond to that third part of your question on our future CapEx today.

On the fuel adjustment clause it is 95% above and below the base and that is consistent with what we received last time.

This is brand protection, and high-value printing, and that's the trend that we're seeing. It's astounding how many of our U.S.-based consumer products are being counterfeited all over the world. Sandy, I mean, this thing is 48 different print projects. Some of the volumes are like 500 million pieces. If we had been able to run our plant 48 hours a day, 365 days a week, we couldn't have come close to fulfilling it. It had mailing -- it's just a monster. But it's good to see the technologies being embraced that in type of approach, and hopefully this will come through, and we'll have a recurring revenue in a company that is a household name around the world. So let's hope that that's successful. Gentlemen, do you have anything else? Otherwise I'm going to summarize. Go right ahead, Robert. Okay. Well, as you've heard, paper and plastic printing, packaging and brand protection, the ability to offer a full-service approach to our clients is the Company we've built. We're continuing to emphasize cost control. I know as you look at the figures for the first quarter it's very hard to tell whether or not we're doing better because a lot of things simply aren't that easy to see.
 The $400,000 customer deferral of classic printing which, as I said, didn't go elsewhere, clearly exacerbated the negatives of the quarter, and as Bob had said, Premier's business historically has been back end loaded toward the second half of the year with its first quarter being the weakest. That also played played on this.
 We can't forget the economy which in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first quarter this year was first beginning to show signs that it was coming out of the doldrums. The expanded licensing with Donnelley, as Sandy's question just highlighted, we're mid-period so we're not yet seeing the trend because we haven't received the latest quarterly checks.
 The Samsung and our relationships, obviously, while exciting, have yet to produce the revenues that we're expecting. But the potential is still there. The Fortune 500 companies that Pat talks about in terms of the expansion of our couponing and printing and not just the number of clients, but the frequency with which we're receiving orders are all the positive trends we're looking for.
 P3's business in printing driver's licenses, DSS's couponing, Premier's new customer that was landed in the last few weeks, added together what we are seeing in terms of trends of organic growth at DPI and the joint bidding that's going on with Premier are really all the types of things that we've hoped we were going to see. I know it's very difficult in this Company to continue to ask people to be patient.
 Once again, I feel like the waiter who keeps bringing everyone the menu, and eventually everyone says, no more menus, I want to eat. I promise you, as a significant shareholder, I'm as hungry as any of our shareholders in terms of seeing that come to fruition in terms of revenues and earnings.
 When we started this process less than two years ago we had a money losing licensing Company, and we began with the initial strategic financial and operational phase of rebuilding this Company by putting additional building blocks in place. P3, DPI and Premier really now allow us to say that we have achieved the goals that we sought in terms of the financial and operational engineering of this Company into a completely new place.
 The goals for the rest of this year, I will tell you personally, I would be extremely disappointed if we can't be at the $18 million to $20 million run rate in the third and fourth quarters and move to what my goal is to see the positive EBITDA. I think that from an economic point of view, personally, I believe we're in a slow but sustainable economic recovery.
 And the Company is now properly positioned to capitalize on that, whereas before, as a licensee we were basically captive to what other people were doing. So a lot of progress has been made in positioning this Company really to ride the trend of an improving economy, and do better even if that takes a lot longer in terms of the general national and world economy. We're all low on patience.
 The next eight months are certainly going to be the test period for both your board and your management, and I can only hope that as we increase our communications to you, hopefully on positive wins, which I feel will be coming with greater frequency, the motto for the rest of the year basically is no excuses. We've got the pieces in place.
 We have an expanded and deeper management team. We're able to offer the customers what they want, and offer them a product that allows us to not only keep a greater percentage of each job in-house but also to increase the margins. And if I'm right, we'll all be able to see these in the ensuing quarters, both at the top line and the bottom line.
 So unless anyone has anything else they would like to add, I would like to thank you all for staying with us, and hopefully we'll have more frequent and better news as time goes on.

  Other questions? Yes, please. Maybe one additional due to the new structure in Canada. How large are you in Canada?

So the legal and regulatory part is in Legal and Regulatory and tax and accounting is in Tax and Accounting.
  We saw good growth in Canada, led by the fact they have a strong software business. They have been able to rapidly increase new products in Canada, because they take the US version of our software and then they modify it. So they have a very good ability to get traction with new products, so that's been driving good growth.

 In terms of the commercial markets, and they're things like new distribution centres, factory expansions, retail and so forth, we're not actually seeing a lot of activity.

 There of course is a bit of a lead time from when companies start to think about spending any CapEx and they actually spend.

And the reason why it's lower than the BIS is mainly because the Swiss grew margin on top of the BIS to calculate the risk-weighted assets. So, the risk-weighted assets on the FINMA are higher than on the BIS. Maybe if I can tie into that comment and tie back to Lukas's comment. We have, as we indicated, CHF8.7 billion of excess client deposits above and beyond what we need to fund our book. And there's a cost to that in terms of risk-weighted assets and return on capital.
 We could take that and move it off balance sheet as an internal product or simply give it back to the clients if we don't need that. And that can be done, as was indicated, in three days. Now, the actual impact of that on our risk-weighted assets, I believe, those are all -- Fred, they're all 20% risk-weighted? Yes. Does that sound right, generally? Yes. So, we're looking at about CHF1 billion of risk-weighted assets, which is roughly about one-sixth to one-seventh of our total risk-weighted assets that could come off with a concurrent increase in our core Tier 1 ratio of a sixth or a seventh, which would be in the range of 15% immediately. And that would give us about 2% uptick on our core Tier 1 on a BIS basis to push us up to 15%, just be not having that excess. So, you just have a trade off.
 And we've decided we'd rather have the excess cushion of deposits, a, because in the event that you do have some weakness on that side at some point you have other deposits; but, b, as and when the markets normalize, those are huge sources of incremental revenues. If you have CHF6 billion, as we do today, of un-invested cash deposits at historical rates of 4% or 5%, you're looking at CHF250 million of revenues.
 Now, I accept the fact that people will not just leave their money un-invested in cash balances. But historically, we've had about CHF3 billion of un-invested cash balances, which historically, at 4% or 5%, has given us CHF150 million to CHF200 million of revenues, which would have flown straight to the bottom line, which we don't have today.
 So, we like to have this business. But it's a bit of drag on our assets, on our risk-weighted assets, and as a result on our total capital ratios, but we could change that tomorrow. We view it as an opportunity as opposed to a problem, but still. Just to [what Lonnie describes]; all these things have been stress tested, and that's exactly what we showed to our Board and to the FINMA 18 months ago. Asia, I think -- just take the CROs; to be clear, I did not say that CROs in general cost more today. I was saying that for us the cost per CRO is going up because we are focusing more on more experienced CROs because in this particular environment the junior CROs just turn out to be less affective.
 The more de-stabilized clients are, the more important it is for CROs who've had a longer relationship with people, where people look over a 10 or 15-year performance track record in terms of service, as opposed to somebody who may have been in the business for three to five years. So, we had more junior CROs in the past. We have been hiring many fewer junior CROs in the current context.
 As and when the markets become more bullish, we may look back at the junior CROs, but at this juncture that's simply not the case. So that drives some of the cost now.
 On the cost line, there's another peripheral impact, which is that we dropped a lot of people's salaries during the course of 2009 because the gross revenue generation was no longer at 3 times their salary. For most of those people, that has gone back and we've reversed that. So, that's been another non-visible effect of the increase of the private client-related AUMs that we've been seeing for our more experienced CROs.
 If I talk about Asia for a moment, we do see that Asia is a competitive environmental. But it really is nothing new. Go back one year, two years, three years, four years, five years, six years, seven years, and go back to [Bitma] and Julius Baer; Asia has been area that everybody says is growing and is going to be a great place. And people have been competing like crazy in that market to get good people. 1998; it was impossible to hire people. 2003; it got sort of heated up.
 So, I think Asia is going to continue to grow. The profit margins do come under pressure from time to time if you really hire the expensive people. What we have tended to do is shy away from the very, very top CROs, simply because we don't want to take the risk that if one of those CROs, who tends to have a highly concentrated client base, isn't able to bring one or two or three clients, they're not profitable.
 And so, we've avoided that risk and the highest cost CROs in that particular bracket. So we're more on the second or third tier, where the risk is a bit lower from a cost standpoint, and the risk is a bit lower from the concentration of client assets standpoint.
 But we don't fundamentally see the dynamics or the profitability of Asian business going down. I think, in contrast to large [swathes] of the rest of the world, the growth rates out there are still healthy and that just makes it a bit easier. And there aren't that many CROs springing out of the ground. So it is an area that having 150 CROs in place today is a bit of a competitive advantage compared to some of the competitors.
 But if I then go finally to pricing, pricing initiatives which you've raised, we are revisiting pricing across the board. We've made some pricing adjustments.
 Certainly, what Jim had referred to in creating hedge fund advisory relationships, we have created a revenue stream. But in addition to that, we're re-pricing some other hedge fund related services on an ongoing basis. And we're re-pricing our loans. And re-pricing loans, so the entirety of the loan structure is moving up considerably. We're looking for a return on equity employed to support our loans of at least 40% -- gross return on equity of at least 40%, which we assume on a cost/income ratio of say 60% should be 15% to 20% net return, pre-tax. That return is not per loan; that return is a relationship with the borrower [as the total loan]. But a gross return of in excess of 40% on capital employed. On the deposit side, the situation is not satisfactory for us only; it's also unsatisfactory for clients given the zero interest rate yield. So, we need to proactively come up with other cash products.
 One very current theme is to have currency deposits, where clients are also adding a put option implicit in a deposit can get 3% to 4% of a zero margin changes there. Another alternative is getting risks clients will take on deposits. And finally, the third alternative is very simple; plain vanilla cash investment funds, where your pricing changes because you go from a net margin on the deposit to a management fee on a fund, which won't be very high, but it certainly is higher than today's yield.
 So, we are -- we have come up with a variety of alternatives to cash products, which not only address our margin situation, but also clients' concerns of yielding constantly zero return on deposits, which currently is the case with deposits with us. If we take one question in the room, and then we switch to the telephone lines and come back to the room afterwards.",test,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

3309974_T,1,{11},"Okay. Let me start with the current contract structure. We do have, and this has been fairly stable over the last years, roughly 25% to 30% of our business based on quarterly contracts, meaning volume-wise long-term contracts where the prices are negotiated quarterly. We do have around 10% half year contracts. And the rest, meaning 55% to 60%, or around 60%, in fact, is one year or more years' contracts, and project business, project business especially in heavy plate, where you do get the contracts not for a period but for a defined project.
 Now we have passed through all the raw material price increases completely in the quarterly contracts, in the semiannual contracts and also in the project contracts which have been concluded in the last month.
 From the 60% -- from the annual or longer-term contracts, this is of course mainly automotive industry, we have renegotiated or newly negotiated, because roughly 50% of the contracts did expire anyway end of June, 85%. So from our total automotive exposure we have renegotiated 85%, or newly negotiated 85% of the volumes. And we have found new agreements. And these 85% more or less all include a full -- the full increase of our raw material cost.
 So we do have only 15% left from the annual contracts which have not been renegotiated and where we have not yet included all price increases. We have included part of the raw material cost increase because, also in these contracts, we do have so-called raw material clauses. But we have not been able to pass through more or less the complete increase of raw material cost.
 Now this is not a big problem because these contracts expire anyway end of the year. So it's just for six months that we have this specific situation. And we are looking forward to the renegotiation of these contracts because we think we are in a quite comfortable position end of the year for these renegotiations. By the way, it's not just because we do expect further price increases. We also do have enough demand from other customers, just in case, to switch from the partners of this 15% to others.
 So this is the current situation for 85% -- no, sorry, for 92% roughly of our overall portfolio we have passed through all the raw material price increases. And only for 7% or 8% if you see the complete portfolio of the Steel division, we have only partly passed through the price increases.

(Interpreted) There should be an improvement, we're waiting for confirmation on this and we're going to do our utmost so that the improvement will be even higher than it was before. I don't know, we will expect, as Jean-Paul just said and we are lobbying not only along but with the other French banks and other people. I was very interested to see that the Scandinavian Banks woke up last week and said, ""Hey guys, what are you doing?"" So the closer you come from the final point more and more people realize what are the risk and the damages.
 So I have no specific, I don't have any specifics insight. We are negotiating, we are discussing with our Government and with the Bank of France. We are talking with other banks in Europe and so and so forth. We are discussing, as you know, with the other CFOs, the 20 CFOs of European banks, all this is working and like all these kinds of process you see the results at the very end.

 Regarding your summary of what we said, I wouldn't say that we are promising or whatever restructuring of capital, I said, first of all, we will see whether we need or not to bridge a gap, I don't know yet. What we've seen is that this summer the gap has reduced and our perspectives are better so all in all it provides for a kind of softer approach of all these issues.
 And second, I say given the flexibility that we have, the belonging of Credit Agricole S.A. to the large Credit Agricole Group, we have some flexibility and ability to maneuver. I don't know what you have in mind when you say restructuring of capital. I like the word mobilizing capital, it's like an army, you mobilize the army but you don't have to send the army to the front line. So the front line is (inaudible) for instance CA-CIB in London, this is the front line, but CA-CIB in London works under the nice umbrella of the Regional Banks in France.

Two questions if I may. The first one is, can you detail how much exposure you have in direct lending to Emporiki, it was EUR7.3b if I understand well last. The direct lending from CASA to Emporiki was EUR7.3b. Has that increased or is it stable? It's more or less stable. More or less stable. Thank you. And the second question is do you see any chance of reversal of provisions as we go forward as some of your peers have experienced? I'm talking about CIB, the provisions are coming down quite rapidly is there a chance of reversal in your view? (Interpreted) We could try and hope for this or dream about it but we're not going to enter into that line of thought for the time being. Hi there, just three questions please. The first one on equities where you basically had one of the best performances in Europe actually in equities, up 7% sequentially. At the moment across the cycle, is cash equities basically 90% of your equities business now? That's the first question.
 The second question is in insurance, can you give us an outlook for growth in the market, in the life market in France given the up-tick that you're seeing now on the Livret A rate? If there's any risk of cannibalization?
 Then the last question coming back to Patrick's earlier one, are you happy with the shape of your balance sheet in terms of the split between shorter term funding and assets and longer term funding and assets, particularly given that you've downsized slightly materially? In five years time could your balance sheet look significantly different because you've made some changes there? Thank you. (Interpreted) In terms of insurance the question as to the split between insurance and Livret A1, I don't think there are any significant movements. At present, of course, we're waiting for the decision of the government as to life insurance in France. Recent evidence has shown that there'll be probably very little movement on this, so we don't think there'll be some movements between both of these types of assets. For the CIB, as usual, our equity business is very difficult from the equity business of others because it's mostly brokerage business with the CLSA, Cheuvreux and Newedge. That's really where you can really not make comparisons with others. Of course 2009 was a very difficult year for all these three businesses, whereas it's much less so the case this year and it's rebalancing in Asia with CLSA and Newedge also enjoying a better performance this quarter. So this is really what are the main drivers between the equity business which is, as you said, almost the exact percentage, it's very close to what we say in terms of proportion.
 The shape of the balance sheet, yes, we are pretty satisfied with the balance between short-term and medium, long-term funding that we have today. The reality and I've discussed that many times is that we have under the auspices of the Bank of France put in place a system over the last two years to manage very carefully and very closely the financing of our various businesses. So each business, each individual business, including each regional bank has its own short-term funding limit. It's not something (technical difficulty). Bruno?

3408278_T,1,{31},"So, when looking at goodwill, the analysis we do is really when we think about the new business we're booking going forward, and the -- let's call it the embedded value of that business or the value of the cash flows, and we look at our ability to price or reprice if given a change in economic conditions or policyholder behavior, et cetera, when we look at the costs associated with securitizing or financing reserves on the business and how that plays into the future profitability of returns, your pricing power in the marketplace, which has a lot to do with your market share, which as you know, is significant at Lincoln -- all those things play into your views of those cash flows if any of those things were to go negative on you, it becomes more expensive to reserve for the product; capital costs increase beyond your assumptions; sales fall off.
  If those things start to happen, that's where you'll see sensitivity around goodwill. The more -- I guess I'd call it more subjective element, is once you have isolated those cash flows, which really need to be proven out in your experience -- particularly your, obviously, your recent experience -- once you've settled in on that, you need to go about the business of discounting those cash flows. And as I mentioned last quarter, there's good news and bad news on that front.
  Certainly, if the view of the risk profile of the business has increased, you would suggest a higher risk premium and a higher discount rate applied to the business. However, given the risk-free rate environment has dropped so significantly, that has a counter-balancing or offsetting pressure lowering discount rates. And you're starting to see a little bit of that, I think, even in some of the transactions that have taken place in the industry, although there's not a lot of great examples.
  And so that will go back and forth, and it's not necessarily a bad thing in terms of the interest rate environment. But what will guide you there is a reasonable expectation for discount rates applied to your business; comparables in the market will guide your thinking; and as we've mentioned before, the reason why you do additional testing on your goodwill when your stock is trading at a discount to book, is because the suggestion in that is that there's a higher discount rate being applied to certain businesses, and so you've got to go that extra step of really analyzing on a segment-by-segment basis.

  As far as next year, I think it will stay at around the same level. This is what I can say right now and what I can say now because it's a mix of geography, a mix of deals, mix of products, mix of channels, and it's quite difficult to predict. I would like to emphasize one other point. We see the increase not as much from the mix and the other parameters but the main factor which is in fact we see within the mix is the trend of the customers to order more license and more feature-rich products. We see that in more and more customers that are gearing up towards very high capacities, very feature-rich licensing to support very large networks.

I think the question regarding offices and expanding our platforms are, as you know, Will, from being around us for nearly four years, since going public -- we're very focused on culture. We're very focused on people.
  We're very focused on work ethic. And we're very focused on people who believe that it's better to be part of an organization like ours and have a small piece of a big pie, as opposed to a big piece of a small pie. If you're not interested in putting the clients' interest ahead of the firm -- if you're not interested in putting the clients' interest ahead of yourself, then it's probably not going to work out for you.
  So, we're in very active discussions with lots and lots of people. And I would say a lot of the inquiries are reverse pings back to us. And I think it's a function of, A, our strong cash position, our balance sheet and, in our opinion, the increased market share we have. So if we can find the right people, we would open up other offices and, frankly, we are talking to people in other markets where we're not currently located.
  And we're, every day, talking to people in existing markets to increase the platform services that we have, as well as increase our specialty lines of business. For example, our industrial -- we really focused on that. We've made a couple of key hires over the last 90 days. We continue to bulk up our retail, our multi-family, our office practice, our hospitality practice, our student-housing practice.
  Our special-asset group is very, very active. There's probably $1 trillion, if you add it all up between the banks, the special services, the life companies that, in our opinion, over the next two to three years, are going to be in some level of distress, or they're over-lent relative to the value of an asset when they first put those loans on the books.
  And, then, when you look at nearly $1 trillion between now and 2017 that are going to come due, it's much like finding a huge oil-and-gas well. We've developed the pipeline, which are our producers. The real question is, how many gallons of oil are you going to pull out of this reserve? Is it going to be 5,000 barrels or 500,000 barrels a day?
  And relative to our cash, that's going to largely be dependent on our activities. And, frankly, as we've said before, we can't figure out a way to invest it in our business, we think our shareholders probably deserve that cash more than we do, but that's probably a discussion that's well over a year down the road -- 18 months.
  We continually discuss that with our Board. After going through 2008 and '09, we're very focused on having a lot of cash on hand. We want people to look at us as a rock, as a place of stability -- and don't have to worry about whether we're going to open up our doors on Monday.

3424438_T,1,{30},"If we're going to sell airports, what is it we do with the proceeds? I'd rather prefer answering this question when we have done this.
 We had this question several times last year and it became obsolete to a high level of frustration from my end and some of our investors as well. I strongly suggest we answer this question when we are there, and you can be assured we have ideas, but it's really too far off.
 The NPV on the non-airport assets, we do not want to discuss here. All these assets we develop to sell them later, and this is why we do not want to give details on our assumptions on the net present value.
 The restructuring charges for the division Europe were approximately EUR20 million which we booked. We had also some restructuring costs in addition to the cost for the departing Board members in the holding. I mentioned we reduced the holding from 600 to 170, the majority of the people moved from holding to the European division, but about 80 left, so there were some costs there as well.
 On the legacy receivables in Habtoor Leighton, let's say, we have put up a reserve of approximately one-third of the legacies. But I find it difficult here and now to give detailed numbers, because that I would like to do only in synchronization with Leighton, and I don't know whether Leighton has or has not given the number.
 So please, that's something we need to follow up, we will check whether Leighton has given the number and if they've given, you will get it. If not please understand that we do not -- that's a question then you may want to ask Leighton, I don't want to interfere with the information they're giving on the matter. But one-third of the legacy debt is provided for.
 I missed -- this I said -- I've missed your Offshore question, sorry Mr. Loskamp.
 I think I said we grew the backlog from EUR20 million to EUR460 million. 2009, the backlog was EUR20 million now it's EUR460 million. We have different types of businesses, one is a straightforward charter where we own and operate the vessels and which we charter out, whether it's to us or whether it's to third parties.
 And now these charter rates are totally different, in terms of calculation on the construction contracts. So, we look to the IRR on the investment, on the ships we have an IRR hurdle of 14% and we are well above those hurdles. And we have given quite some, how do I call this, spare time. So the challenge there is that we may end up in a year not being able to fully charter the ship, that we have some time in between some charters.
 And we currently see that we are doing much better compared with our charter assumptions. So we don't have that much of extra time where the ship is not chartered, the vessel is not chartered; they are fully chartered. So that looks very good.
 On the Construction contracts, which we have as well, they are typical construction contracts, so no money invested; a straightforward payment for the work. We have published that our construction, civil construction target rates, our return on sales of minimum 5% with those contracts, we are ahead of that minimum. So we achieve more than 5%.
 We've also put up, and intend to do so, risk contingencies which are for risk, but also, of course, have an opportunity to turn into profit if we don't need them. So it's a bit early now to say in detail what is the final outcome of these construction contracts, but at least the calculations show that we are above what is the normal target.
 And then the third question, or the third part of the business is the one which we've just started to enter, which is the joint venture companies with Ventizz on the offshore concessions. And there, again, we have the hurdle rates for our investments, which is IRR 14% and we are above those hurdle rates.
 One more detail on your second question which was NPV on the other assets. What we can say, Lars just gave me the number, is that the paid in capital as we've said for the airports, we, of course, can do this for the non-airport assets.

So, we continue to start the quarter in somewhat of a hole compared to the prior years. No real change in that percentage. And then on the Project Devil front, there are numerous things that we -- and let me quickly describe what that project was. The project basically was around advertising and the mixing of advertising with the consumer experiences on content pages. We did a content study on AOL with our own pages and then looked across the web. Most sites only had 20% to 30%, ours were 18% of our pages had content on them above the fold. We drastically increased the amount of content on the pages we redesigned.
  Two is, we found that a lot of our pages, we removed a lot of ads off our pages over the last year, but the reality is, with Project Devil what it allows us to do is put the entire ad funnel all the way from awareness down to interactions or store locators are things in one ad. One consumer, one ad on the page, better content experience, better ad experience. The results we saw were stronger consumer interaction with the ad. People were 68% more likely to buy the product that they saw in the Project Devil ads after seeing Project Devil than before Project Devil. Then on the consumer side of those pages where there's one ad and more content on the page, on average consumers stayed on the pages for 22 seconds longer. So, 22 seconds longer across hundreds of thousands of pages starts to be a meaningful improvement in the consumer experience. Then specific stats around it, Devil was about eight times better than a normal 728 by 90 ad banner. And was basically twice as good as the larger ad units that run on the Internet today.
  Overall net/net, better consumer experience and better metrics around consumers and meaningfully better ad experiences and interactions with ads.

It's a very flexible plant, which it was always intended to be, and that's quite an advantage given in Romania you actually have prices remarkably enough, actually higher than West Germany at the moment, the western part of Germany.

  But not only do you have a higher level of average prices than you have in Germany, you also have very high levels of peak prices. And one of the attractive points of the plant that we have is its flexibility and ability therefore to capitalize on these peaks.

We've just been bouncing around a tough market environment, and I think that our perception is there was nothing particularly extraordinary quarter-to-quarter over that slight change over our margin.
 I think that our focus has been you've just got to kind of weather this out. We can't make the global trade bounce back. It's off a little bit, but this isn't something from our perspective that is a huge swing related to some particular event. I think it's more reflective, Ken, of what we see to be just a persistently different market for the shipping guys.

3469796_T,1,{3},"Well, I think if there is a change in our guidance about the 12% from the full year or in the course of the year, I think it is perhaps not unusual to be cautious in this current environment, with the economic uncertainties resulting from the state debts and financial markets. So I think this is a marginal situation.
 As to the increase in specific of turnover and profitability, we are not giving this at the moment. Clearly, I said we are expecting the substantial price increases in raw materials and energies to be passed on, and passed on in such way that we might recover, recoup some of the margin, so that we get back to this 20% by the end of the next year. This is, in essence, the type of guidance we can give to you now.
 In GMS, it's, clearly, the situation that GMS is a relatively long cyclical business. The production cycles alone are around six months plus/minus. And it is, to a large extent, investment good industry-related or very near. So the cycles are long and this business was hit latest by the -- or last by the recession. So it had still a low situation in the early part of 2010, when other businesses had already recovered. This is part of the substantial increase in comparison year to year.
 Now the improved margins are purely now consequences of many new developments coming to fruition in the area of solar, semiconductor, LED, lithium ion batteries, diesel particle filters and many applications. And they benefited from the very high capacity utilization and, hence, the fixed costs dilution and also, obviously, in situations like the price increases.
 So this is the summary of the reason why GMS is running so high at the moment, which, as I said, we will not expect to continue at that very high level. The activity is slowing down somewhat, albeit not dramatically, but we will get back to a more normal level. And our guidance on GMS, as I said, and I can only repeat, the minimum guidance is 10% and we say we will be substantially above that in 2012, albeit not at the record levels achieved this year.",train,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE

If it increases the way I think it would, given that this repair work really hasn't been done for five or six years, and a lot of our competitors have dropped by the wayside because they weren't diversified like us, they couldn't get into subcontracting like we did, certainly not fast enough, and are no longer in that mix, I think it is a very real possibility that when this business returns, we are going to be a major player in it.

Yes, NLG as we have talked about previously has become a very commoditized product. The channel that sells that product is highly commoditized, it is a third party wholesaling channel in general. What we have tried to focus on are those markets and segments where we can bring our direct company wholesaling force to bear.
 As we do in our group business and our variable annuity businesses, which we view as a more sustainable value proposition to the end customer and to the advisers that we work with. We are building that capability out. The flip side of the equation on exiting NLG, is we did see as you know, a decrease in our domestic UL sales, but I am very confident that the alignment of our wholesaling force, the building of that wholesaling force going more directly to producers in the kinds of markets that you have articulated, the small business owner market, will really bear fruits for us, and will be more sustainable long term.

  On the portfolio, my point of view is that there are no sacred cows in this portfolio. I'm not driven by size of the business and I'm not driven by diversity, per se. I want to look at all these businesses from the point of view of how do we move shareholder return.

David, just to respond to the question about the JAK-3, the data that we presented last year at ACR, we showed the liver enzyme elevation data. There were relatively few liver enzyme elevation events. They tended to occur at a similar rate across each of the treatment groups and placebo groups, so there was no statistically significant difference between the groups, and importantly, there was no evidence of any liver damage in any patient, whether a placebo-based patient or an active patient. So, we're fairly confident in the data that we've seen so far with regard to liver enzymes.
  And with regard to next presentation, the data, we're going to see several trials read out in the first half of this year, and we will look for opportunities to present the data as soon as possible, potentially as early as the EULAR meeting around the middle of the year, and then at ACR later this year.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

 We have a converting facility in Chicago that produces normal converting broke. It's just the things that come from logs that get cut off and you have these doughnuts and those types of things that just go with the normal tissue process. We are now going to take that back to Nina instead of shipping it all the way back to Lewiston.
 So that saves us on Consumer Products freight, but it actually also lowers Nina's cost of fiber because Nina was purchasing pulp from the outside, of course, at the full outside purchase price of pulp. So we do two things. We reduce freight and we reduce some of the outside purchasing requirements. So things like that.
 We have also been looking at what we could do to really optimize the converting capacities that we have throughout the whole system. We have an operation in Nina that has a very terrific wide operating line; it's not running full.
 And we think that through some combinations of moving some wrappers around and shifting some of our products from different sites we can actually create additional converting capacity by doing that. So we are very excited about that and, of course, that helps us a lot from a cost standpoint as well as a customer service standpoint.
 So exiting warehouses around the country that we may not need as Shelby comes up according to schedule that Roger had asked about earlier that will give us some additional warehouse space. We can exit ourselves out of a Texas finished goods warehouse and put some of that inventory there or into the Oklahoma City plant, which has some space.
 But anyway, I could go on and on. But there is lots of things like that that as we get deeper and deeper into the business feel really, really fun to do. Very exciting for us.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

But we are in the process of analyzing whether we need more, even after we make such acquisitions. That's right, the first half, yes. What we have seen, again as we started to see late in last year some relief on prices, particularly in virgin fibers, but also a little bit on recycled fibers.
 Now, you know that you see those price decreases, and it takes a little bit of time for those to reflect in actual results because one thing is for those prices to be announced, and then as you go through a whole supply chain and through inventories and you actually get it out and it has an impact in your results, it takes a little bit of time. So, those reductions that we saw in the fourth quarter should start to have some effect in the first quarter and certainly by the second quarter of the year.
 Now, with respect to what could happen to the fibers going forward, well, that's a good question because [Rece] for the past 1.5 years has been forecasting that fibers will continue to drop, and as the last year progressed, they were postponing those price decreases further and further. Current forecasts show that prices should continue to decrease throughout the first half of the year, and then have moderate increases for the second half. Now those are the market forecasts.
 We at least believe that prices should be or will be flat for the first half of the year, and again, if that happens, that will give us time for both our pricing and mix actions, which we've taken quite a few of them, and our cost-reduction programs, which we talked about, to catch up with the very aggressive and rapid price increases we saw over the past 14, 16 months.

3689235_T,1,"{3,5}","Well as you probably understand, pricing is the most sensitive issue competitively as practiced in the market. Having said that, it is also a hard question to answer in that there are different price points for different services and different volume levels, and the actual retail price is set by our distributors, not by us.
  So I guess what I will say to you is in the Maritime market specifically we have done a couple of things. One is we have priced data services in bundled packages, which gives our big customers the ability to share bundles of data volume among ships. And that has gone down very, very well, and it is more economical for them. It sometimes involves a higher expenditure level than they historically have made, so that tends to generate higher revenue per ship.
  On the low end, the voice end, the primary driver there is not competition. The primary driver there is really what is happening with substitution of data and e-mails for voice minutes. So we have also addressed the pricing issue in competitive terms and have had crew calling packages put in place, and there will be more of that to come during the course of the year.
  So in that market, you can say the high-end with VSAT is the main issue. And that we have addressed, I think, quite solidly and we are seeing the results of that start to come through now.

3698140_T,1,"{7,10}","Actually it's not the understanding of immunology that is getting better, but it's the understanding of how to discover additional novel molecules in the field of immunology that is getting better. So we are not reinventing immunology, but we do discover how -- we do discover biological rules to finally say that we may apply in order to come up with novel discoveries in this field.
  So -- and actually I would want to relate to that we are not -- and this was usually in all the last decade or so what we were doing, we were not finding new biological phenomena. We were modeling biological phenomena. We were understanding the rules behind the assurance of the biological phenomena and we could then apply to multiple areas of discovery and come up with new discoveries that should happen because this phenomenon occurred.
  So we don't come up with identifying novel biological phenomena. We are understanding the underlying science behind the phenomena which have us to predict what would be the outcome of this phenomenon, whether it would create a new transcript, whether it would create a new protein or a new peptide and what would this new product -- gene product would be working for?
  And we take this as the underlying capability of Compugen to come up with new product discoveries. I hope it was clear enough. Yes, thank you very much. First, again, thanks to everyone for participating in the call, nice to see with each of our calls now the increasing number of participants and seeing some new names and some of our old friends.
  I would like to conclude just by mentioning or pointing out how Compugen as we end 2010, begin 2011 is in many ways a very significantly different Company then as we ended 2009 with respect to -- particularly with respect to the core of the Company, the R&D capability. I'm not suggesting in any way that we've changed our strategy or that we are doing different things than we were before, but a number of different elements have kind of matured and come together, so that for example whereas we were looking at many, many different disease states and whatever at the end of 2009, now clearly we have a very strong focus in the areas of oncology and immunology.
  And along with that, we have made the transformation from essentially seeing what our various platforms could discover and what we would find by validating those platforms. We've move towards integrating all of our research capabilities, so now we can -- we have the opportunity to look at market needs and then bring all of our various discovery capabilities together to try and solve -- to go after that specific need.
  And you can see the result with the first program of that type, which was where CGEN was one of the -- one of nine product -- unique product candidates discovered.
  And then thirdly, of course is the Pipeline Program whereas at the end of 2009, we were moving forward a few of our molecules towards animal model work, now we have substantially broadened it and we have a multitude of product candidates moving forward. And in addition, we will select some of these and we have selected some of these to actually go beyond the animal model 18 months. This is a very, very important decision for us because when you take -- go post 18 months, post the animal model results, you are into the normal stage where large pharmaceutical companies are comfortable licensing in products.
  So when you combine all of that, it clearly is, as I said, a very different type of capability we have now. It's proven, it's enlarged, and of course, we have the resources that we need. We haven't been in this good a financial situation for many years and we are clearly looking forward to being able to report additional accomplishments through the remainder of this year and as we move forward.
  So again, thank you very much for your confidence in us. For those of you that have been around for a while, it's been a long haul, but in the world of life science, this is the time to really spend -- do your homework and create things of value.

You mentioned that Redwood -- -- deal done with Citi last year, right. That was incredibly high quality securities and, yes, I don't think the issue is that where investors want to buy AAA securities isn't at a low enough yield where someone can profitably originate the loan. They think it is at a low enough yield, right? I think the issue is more on the mechanics of getting things rated and also people having a better understanding of what sort of retained risk entities need to keep and what entity needs to keep it. Is it who originated the loans? Is it who aggregated the loans?
  So I think some of those issues, right, but from where I sit when I look at the yields in the marketplace I think that the bids for AAA securities right now should be tight enough to drive some new originations if you had these other factors worked out. And this is Larry. I would just like to just add one more thing as far as Ellington Financial is concerned, and just looking back historically first. If you look at what some of the great opportunities have been in the mortgage market over the years, I think that obviously people remember the RTC liquidations.
  They remember the '94 bond market crash. They remember of course the current crisis starting in 2007/2008, but one thing that actually isn't remembered that well, but that we remember very well here, was that after 1998 a lot of the lower quality originators went out of business, especially in what was then the subprime space and similar products like 125% LTV mortgages and whatnot.
  So there was a several year period when a segment of the market that had been catered to as far as consumers are concerned were not able to get mortgages. And then, -- so again there are a lot of analogies to today. And then finally in the early part of the 2000s, starting in 2001 especially, that market started to come back and subprime originations started to come back again.
  And for the first few years, from I would say '01 to '04, the opportunities for a buy side firm were tremendous. The quality of the mortgages, again, as a market that hadn't been catered to for awhile, so there was huge demand. The originators could be very selective and originate high quality mortgages.
  The investors who had been burned in '98 and whatnot were loath to get back in, especially at the lower end of the capital structure. So -- and those were just tremendous buying opportunities back then.
  So I see the same thing happening and you will see the first securitizations in the prime space of course, and then you will see capital start to come back to other parts of the lending space and the underwriting guidelines will be much better, as you have seen.
  So I think there will be a lot of opportunities, and as Mark has mentioned on several occasions including today mentioning Basel III, the capital requirements and just the technicals of the market have created a huge vacuum in the lower rated parts of the sector, including when there is new origination and you are not going to be originating only AAA tranches, you are going to be originating lower rated tranches, as well.

All they have to do is create 10 jobs in the deal they're putting their money into.
  Well, in the hotel business that's not looking -- that's not a great idea because hotels are simply supply, and by the way, what kind of -- let's go back to EB5 for a minute.What kind of return is someone looking for when they're buying a green card? They're buying a green card so their kids can go to school in the United States. They're buying a green card so they can travel outside the United States more freely because their passport may not have the ability to be as flexible as a US passport. And then they may be, thirdly, maybe even want to come here, but in most cases that's not even their main motivation. So they're putting this money in expecting certainly a low level of return, if anything.
  I couldn't tell you exactly what they expect, but I know it's not much. So, in essence, it becomes a subsidy, yet the government says we're not subsidizing it because we're not putting government money in. We're just selling green cards, but whether the government is subsidizing it or foreign investors are subsidizing it, it is a -- it creates subsidies improperly -- by the way, we're fine with subsidies. Subsidies, when they are used to create demand, bring new bodies to a market, generate new spending, are great, but when they simply are for things like hotels where it's just a regular -- I'm sure it's a nice Marriott, but a regular Marriott -- all that it does is increase the supply. And if the pie doesn't get any bigger, we're just going to cut it into smaller slices. So, we have to be able to get more people to come to Milwaukee.
  Simply, I will pay good money to the first person I hear say, I heard there was a great Marriott in Milwaukee. I really want to go there and check it out. It's not like people come here. I would say the same thing about our Hilton. They come here because they've got family here. They come here because they have business here. They come here because there's a convention here. And until we get more people to come for those reasons, building a Marriott is not going to solve the problems of downtown. It sounds great. It feels great. We're starved for development, so it feels like something's happening. But it's very short sighted without the increase in demand.
  Now, the truth is, it's the only Marriott core brand in downtown Milwaukee now. We've got a Residence Inn and a Courtyard, and those properties over perform based on their market share, where they are, how they do, because somebody calling it a Marriott system, a very strong system, will default to those if they want their Marriott rewards points. So, I think they're probably the most vulnerable, but it will take from other properties. It will take from the Pfister. It will take from the Hilton. It will take from the Intercom. I don't know how much. Being right across from the Pfister, it will -- we will feel it. I have no doubt.Unless, of course, our community can get more demand [generators].
  And I've challenged the community, and I've challenged our mayor and said, please, tell us how are we going to get more bodies down here. Tell us what your game plan is. The mayor was very supportive of the Marriott, as is his prerogative, but I said, okay, if you're going to be supportive of that hotel being built with a subsidy, then please tell me how are we going to get more people here. Because if not, the 10 jobs you create there are going to leave the Residence and the Courtyard and the Pfister and all the other hotels, because we won't have beds to clean. We won't have people to feed, because they'll be at the Marriott.
  So, it's a long-winded question -- a long-winded answer to your question, I'm sorry, but you got me on my soapbox. And it's something that bothers me because I get concerned, obviously, when we just subsidize product. And people don't really understand EB5. It's sort of a new tool in the developer's toolkit, and I'm not against the use of subsidy, as I said, but it needs to be properly used, not just to build something for the sake of building it.",train,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

As I said in my prepared remarks, we launched 21 new OTC products in the quarter, we launched over 90 last year and we anticipate we will launch 200 this year by the first half. In the first quarter, as I think I mentioned on an earlier Q, we did a little over $8 million related to those new products. That was up year-over-year around $3 million, given that there's very little incremental cost. That dropped about $0.03 of earnings to the bottom line on a year-over-year basis, dropped about $0.08 to the bottom line in the quarter. So those products continue to be meaningful contributors to our bottom line and, as I mentioned, we've got a long backlog of products that we will anticipate to rollout over the coming months and then certainly as you get into the back half of the year as well. Yes, so the 16-18 I guess I got more bullish than the chart overnight, but I'm confident that for the month we will be in that $16 million to $18 million range.

And last year, the $12.6 million includes a similar add back on the debentures and some one-time charges regarding our transaction predominantly that we went through in terms of the recap.

I think I also said that we'd started slightly later because people didn't come in the ground -- onto the ground because we're talking [to the IFAs] at the end of March, so we effectively started later in 2010.
 And what we are seeing is there's some new things that are coming through. Within that number there's probably more Standard Life Investment spend, than there was in 2010. I don' think I talked a lot about Standard Life Investments having a big uptick in expenditure last year. And a lot of it goes back to what Keith's been saying about seeing a broadening range of possibilities, also looking at different asset classes.
 So the mix of it is probably much more towards investment propositions rather than maybe platform technologies, whereas platform technologies were probably more in 2010.
 Jackie, do you want to take the other two questions? Sure. On the UK fee bps, I should have mentioned actually as part of my session that we will be holding an investor day later in the year, and one of the things we will talk about is the legacy versus some of the new products because I think there is a misconception. We are taking a huge number of increments into existing schemes, so I think trying to pull apart one scheme what is coming in today and reading that through is too simplistic.
 So in terms of the kind of overall trends, we can pick that up in the course of that. As I say, one of the key things to keep in mind is that it's not that we've switched off looking existing schemes and suddenly we're writing something fundamentally different. A large proportion of those schemes continue to generate significant amounts of revenue, and as a consequence profits, for us as well.

3957489_T,1,"{47,49,50}","(Interpreted). The difference from the Lehman Brothers -- collapse of the Lehman Brothers; well, the question I believe is that the impact of the earthquake so I gave the answer earlier. But the first quarter -- how will the first quarter differ from the previous -- the first quarters in the past; it's not different. April and until the May timeframe there's -- companies are still formulating their budgets so it's very uncertain. It's not a very active time for the advertisers so the part that we don't know is that, as a result, after the mid-May whether we have an environment where we can run the advertising or not.
 The difference from the Lehman shock is that, in the case of 2008, the economy -- global economy started to go down and it was quite uncertain at that time, and the budget of the advertisers were based on that. When would the impact end it was totally uncertain. We were going through trials and errors at that time but, this time, when you consider the advertisers trying to formulate the budget, of course there is a nuclear power plant issue but there was an earthquake and then what was the damage and how do we build -- rebuild including the sales channel? It is different from the uncertainty that we had after the collapse of the Lehman Brothers, which was stronger in terms of the uncertainty. Maybe at the end of May/June we will see the very active advertising so that would be same as the usual first quarter.
 As for the advertising, your question was about the result. The overall advertising year-on-year double-digit growth was observed. In answering your question, compared to the growth of the third quarter it was lower, although we maintained a double-digit growth.
 As for the fourth quarter, it was lower than what we expected and probably we -- 80% of the ad was gone, so there were some last-minute advertising until March 10. Usually, we start to see some enquiries so compared with the fourth quarter last year it was JPY400m to JPY500m promotion with last-minute advertising and we expected the same level for this year. But it was not zero but that was about the level of the numbers that we considered including.
 As for display, the third quarter is more than double; it was very strong growth. But the fourth quarter was down, especially year on year. The March last year -- sorry, the third quarter -- March, last year, was very strong so it was one-digit growth.
 And, as for listing, January and February, before the earthquake, was growing very strong, so double-digit. But, unfortunately, it was not as high as third quarter but it was higher than the second quarter, so a very strong quarter I believe. I hope that answers your question.
 As for IM, it wasn't bad but, as I mentioned, in the case of IM the number of advertisers is still relatively low and, unlike the search, sensitive filter -- unsuitable sensitive filter to get rid of the inappropriate advertising, but by using that filter we try to eliminate the unsuitable or inappropriate ads. But usually there is a time lag or it takes time before we see the effect, usually two weeks -- one to two weeks. Because of the filtering it's down so the growth of the IM, roughly speaking, is 20%, 30% but now it's down to single-digit growth.

4025319_T,1,"{3,4}","I will start on that. At the time of our Q4 call we had only bought spring and summer, and we just started buying fall. We made the assumption at that time that holiday pricing would ease, because we were buying fall into what we believed at the time was the peak of cotton. We do most of our holiday buying -- and as you guys know, our holiday buys are our biggest buys of the year. We do most of our holiday buying through the months of March, April, May. We are actually not all the way done, and we still have our trends and spring assortments that come into Q4 still to go.
  But we had made the assumption at the time that our fall buys would be the most expensive, and that we would get some easing in our holiday buys. And it turns out we were just absolutely wrong on that assumption. Holiday got worse, and that costing came in much higher than we expected, and higher than fall. As we said on in the opening comments, the real focus here is Old Navy and our outlet business. As you look at it in hindsight, for the last three years we have done a lot of work, whether it is on fabric, on trim, on choices for that business. We've got -- we've gotten some of our benefit on the operating margin of the business to 2010 by some of the work that all our teams did.
  Maybe we were a little ahead of the curve, because when new management came in in 2007, and then the recession started to show its -- show up at our door, we started to move on a number of different fronts. One was SG&A and one was AUC, which we talked about on all these calls.
  And we did some good work. Do I still think back then we had the lowest costs? No. Do I still think today there are always opportunities for the business in terms of two ways of coming to market through negotiations for us to get better costing. I mean, that is what we always have to believe when you're dealing as a retailer to a vendor.
  But at the end of the day when cotton went above $2 around that February mark and sustained itself for almost 12 full weeks, which was around the time, as Sabrina said, we were in the midst of negotiations for our holiday product, we didn't have any leverage.
  And I am with her. I really thought when we were looking at it -- I think we said this on a call in February, we know a lot more about cotton than we did a year ago. We have been talking to everybody. I was out for 12 days out in Asia, in our hubs, meeting with vendors one-on-one, trying to understand what options we had, what could we do, all the different tools available to us.
  Even then, Jeff, in fairness -- that was two months ago, and even then meeting with vendors and talking very specifically about what was going to happen at holiday, even they didn't have the clarity that people like me would want, given the responsibility I have in the business.
  Our team is still there today working very hard to try to still -- because holiday, as Sabrina said, is not complete -- but there is no way we were going to come on the call today and not let people know with all the information we have. And it is in real time this information. I mean, it is changing every single day.
  So we are giving the best information we have today. There is still a huge amount of pressure on our team. And I'm obviously disappointed at the numbers we are giving today. We've got a huge amount of pressure on our vendor community, because we are disappointed in the numbers they're quoting back to us, and how they are taking like-for-like product up that 20% level or greater in Old Navy and in our outlet business.
  So, look, we haven't all of a sudden gone brain-dead when it comes to our ability to negotiate, the 50 countries we use, the hubs. But we are very cotton invested as a business in those two brands, more than anybody else. Definitely a much bigger part of anything in our portfolio. And our teams are not giving up, but as we sit here today, this is the best information we have and the forecast we wanted to come forward with.
  But it is continued -- tomorrow I will have new information. It continues to move. We continue to fight the good fight. But cotton at almost a 300% increase versus LY -- I may be off a little bit on that, but directionally correct. And given the amount of cotton [means] to our product, we took a holiday hit much bigger than we thought three months ago. But it is based on the information we have today.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
4037767_T,1,"{17,19}","Okay. On the programming costs, before doing anything or changing any programming, the costs we do would come down already on the second quarter and we are expecting them to come down year on year on the second quarter for one reason only.
 We had the World Cup Football rights on June, which, as you know, is a substantial investment and it was June and the first week of July. This year, we'll not have any big events. Also on a smaller scale, we had the Rock in Rio event last year. This year, we're not having any big events.
 So like-for-like on the second quarter, we are expecting lower programming costs.
 Now for the rest of the year, we have not decided yet to -- right now we do not have -- we had two lines of fiction up to end of April. We are not -- probably we will not repeat two lines of fiction from September onwards when we are expected to resume that. But I would expect the program lineup from September onwards to be fairly similar, in prime time, to what we have today, in May.
 Secondly, the other programming reductions which we're going to have will mainly affect daytime in the weekdays. We are probably going to use more -- we are going to do more repeats of soaps, Portuguese or Brazilians, rather than do new releases. That will start only probably during the summer months as the current programming comes to an end. And we'll do the same thing over the weekends, which most of you are aware, we are -- weekends, afternoons and mornings are full of children's programming and films and series.
 You would expect, with exception of the Christmas period, to have substantial more repeats over those periods, which should allow us and contribute us to a drop in programming costs in line with the programming -- with the total costs cut which we expect of around 5% to 6%.
 With related to RTP, we are aware that one party has put on their program that in the foreseeable future RTP will be -- or at least one channel of RTP could be privatized. Right now we do not have any comments.
 Privatizing a channel would be an enormous challenge because of all the issues involved, in terms of financing, public service which usually things which have never been -- the difficult things are never on debate in Portugal.

If I understand well your point, you want to know how we see the market condition for Vinyl Products and Acrylics for the second semester, is that your point? So in construction, as I mentioned to Amy, we are in construction in Europe for PVC. You have certainly differences between the south and the central part of Europe where the central part of Europe is okay and the southern part of Europe, especially Italy and Spain are difficult. But everybody knows that.
 I would say on average looking at the months ahead, I would say that we see sort of a stability of the market conditions. The fact that ethylene has decreased in June has certainly lowered our volumes in June. That is something that will come back. So I would say all in all some stability for PVC.
 With regard to Acrylics, you know that we are at a high level of unique margin. On the supply side we see, in fact, more good news than bad news. This means that it is tight and we believe that some projects in China maybe would take longer than expected. So we maintain what we say and that we see for the next years a good balance between supply and demand.
 On the short-term demand side, you have the coating market which is more difficult in Europe and US and you have seen some figures of the paint company on the Europe and US for the coating market. But on the other side, all the businesses of oil production, water treatment, diet pills, (inaudible) are doing quite well.
 So I would say on Acrylics you will have, on the second part, still a good environment, but we see effect of seasonality which is taken into our guidance like every year. Hello. Thanks for taking my question. Questions actually; I have three.
 The first one is on the tax rate and tax set. If you could confirm, because as far as I remember you should have around EUR500m of the tax losses and you plan to realize it in 2015. So I just wanted to know what is your view on the next year tax rate in regards to that, and how this EUR500m will be spread over the year. That's the first one.
 The second one is an improvement in profitability in Performance Products. Could you please comment because the profitability improved obviously quarter on quarter and year on year? Could you please comment which subdivisions are the main contributors? Is it the start up of the Kynar plant or where do you see particular improvement in profitability in Performance Products?
 The third one is about PVC business. What are your plans on the PVC business? Do you see further divestments, or is it a strategic division for Arkema or not? Thank you. Okay I propose that Thierry answer the first question. Okay so as far as tax losses in France are concerned, we have not started yet to recognize any deferred tax asset which means that the low rate that you have seen during the first half of the year is not related to this element. It's a subject that we will look at very carefully at the end of the year. And the improvement of the performances in France place us in a rather good position. So it's a subject for the end of the year, but it could have positive impact on the coming year.
 I'm not sure I understand that we will be in a position to start to recognize them as soon as 2012. But as I said, it's an element that could improve further the tax rate.
 The reason why we have a lower tax rate than the one that we anticipated initially is due to two elements. The first is that the relative weight of the result in France where we are not paying taxes because of the specific situation is higher than what we anticipated initially. And the second element which occurred during the second quarter is a positive element because we have been in a position to recognize deferred tax asset in Spain. Not in France but in Spain.
 So all in all, we achieved a tax rate of 24.4% I think on the semester, and as I said, I expect the ratio, the rate for the whole year to be at around 26%. And the size of the tax asset in France currently? Oh yes you're right, it's around EUR450m of potential deferred tax assets. Okay, so this is quite a good upside for the future as you know. And also, I would like to mention that we have been a little bit above, we appreciate, the consensus for the quarter in EBITDA, plus 6%. But in the net result it is significantly more than that. It has come from the fact that we have -- what we can call a conversion rate from EBITDA to net result which is now significantly better than the industry.
 I'm sure something you can take maybe some more guidance that we give later, but we could take that in your model because it certainly participates to the value of the Company.
 On Performance p\Products, first of all, we are certainly very happy about the result of the Performance Product on this quarter because we promised to you four or five years ago that this Performance Product business, line which was a mixed bag of different businesses with a low profitability, we would take it to the level of our best appearance. This is what we are doing and certainly through our work options we have reduced the costs very significantly and we benefit from it.
 We have made, and it comes to your question, some I think, good investments like the recent one which is fluoropolymers in China. So the biggest contributors are certainly our specialty polymer. You know that in polyamide '11 and '12 we are in a very good position and it's a business which is developing, not at a top line because we have no more capacity, but at a bottom line because we are changing complexity of product mix. And the fluoropolymers both at the top line and the bottom line because we are adding step by step capacity.
 And you know that in China we have started this plant. But we have already announced six months ago that we would add 50% to the plant in China and we are pushing on the development in photovoltaic, in paints in batteries. So it's doing -- it's going quite well.
 And also maybe one business unit that we don't mention too often which is Ceca, which is a specialty chemicals business unit, which is specialized in filtration and absorption which is doing, frankly speaking, very well in this second quarter.
 So no, I think that really reflects certainly an economy which appreciates these kind of products. But also, certainly, the very good job which has been done to transform completely in-depth this sector.
 With regard to PVC, we have not changed our mind or our position and step by step we reduce the size. We have made a small divestment recently. We could make some other small divestment in the next years and series of years.
 PVC, the PVC sector was at 25% in terms of revenues of Arkema when in 2005, now it's 18%. But once we have integrated resins coming from Total, it will be 16%. And as you know we target 12% for the medium-term, so this is still our target to have Vinyls to be at 12% of total Arkema sales. And to focus on the best percent, the most competitive one, and to divest the rest, we have not changed our strategy. Thank you. You're welcome.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

On the costs, you know I think that the ability to turn on and off costs is always an issue in terms of times when you have a substantial reduction in income. As I say, I think it's more an income story than a cost story.
  You know I think overall the dependence we have had on trading income, as you know has always been quite high, and we have been moving to change that dependence to a customer sales focused or more customer sales focus in terms of the revenue generation, and we've actually seen a 16% increase in sales volumes this year, which I think is an extremely good result. That will continue, that will continue to move forward.
  So it's not that trading will not be important, it means that it will not be as important in terms of the overall mix of business, and that's the way we're going to move out of that dependence Jonathan.
  In terms of the capital, I didn't understand that. No, well Jonathan's spot on in his question, and there are a few things that happened in terms of Q4. One - if you think about the way this works, Q3 had the accrual of the DRP. We accrued the DRP at 30% and then as you actually have the DRP take place you recognize the difference between the accrual and the actual, so it has the benefit of the 10% coming into Q3. Q4 didn't have that.
  Q4 had very strong risk weighted asset growth. Now that's a good news story and a bad news story. Good news story in the sense that it implies there are new volumes in there for earnings, but it did chew into capital.
  So for the year, risk weighted assets were consuming 43 bases points, but the annualized rate in Q4 was 93 bases points - so double the growth.
  Now Jonathan you said it was in corporate, but of course that's corporate AIRB which means its institutional lending, it was fundamentally institutional lending, undrawn loans in Australia and Asia, reflecting the growth in that part of the business, and us picking up more market share in those areas.

And until we have at least a couple of months or so of experience with the entire installation being settled in, it is tough to draw a conclusion. I mean directionally, excuse me, what happens is pretty much every machine and every shop has seen its CashBox increasing nicely since they were installed.
  And generally speaking, these numbers, or at least these quantifications, are pretty well known, running considerably ahead of the performance of the previous supplier, and very rapidly gaining, relative to the Ladbrokes's competitors in the UK. On the other hand, I'm not exactly privy to the scheduling that was developed over the time it took to install the machines. But my guess is, that the higher performing shops in general were converted first, and the weaker performing shops were converted last.
  So if we look at month to month averages, we would get a somewhat distorted view of what is really going on, because of the averages being pulled down, by the fact that lower performing shops are coming no the average. And I said a second ago, even they are showing their own month to month improvements, as time goes on. So I think it will be another few months at least before -- I think it is going to be a long time before we see the average CashBox top out. But it is going to begin to sort of [asymptotically] level out a little bit a few months down the road.
  But we're not there yet. And as I said generally, within a particular shop, we're seeing month to month improvement. And most importantly, we're seeing what was everybody's hope is that there would be a significant stepping up of in performance, when the switch was made from the previous supplier to ourselves. Notwithstanding the fact that, it is generally the experience in these markets, as I'm sure you know, Todd, that when you have this kind of a switch, there is more often than not, initially a very significant drop in CashBox, because the players have to adjust to new games, new boxes, new mechanics, and so forth. And yet notwithstanding that, that is normally the case, by and large, that was not the case during this deployment. And what I would add that, Todd, Ladbrokes reported sort of 15% CashBox improvement, and growth win per terminal week of about GBU850.

4171560_T,1,{18},"Good morning Liz. I'm guessing it's a very early morning for you. I think a couple of points that I think are really important for everybody to keep in mind for both our LaJobi and our soft lines businesses, and that make us perhaps a little bit different than some other players in the industry. In both cases, we are relatively high price point product lines.
 I mean, cribs our multi hundred dollars to the consumer, a bed set is a couple hundred dollars. So, we do think there's a bit of softness in this generally relatively weaker consumer world to the higher price point products. And so, we think that has reduced some unit volume in both cases at the general consumer levels.
 That would be 1 point to keep in mind that's a bit peculiar to us, but we suspect will straighten out over time but that's affected us lately. The other thing, and I will really reinforce strongly, we've really focused here in the last half year on our soft line businesses on some of the issues that we had in last year that are within our control in areas like design and some of that, especially Kids Line.
 We feel very good where we've gotten to. When I was talking to you back in March of this year, my guess is, for example, would've had a minority of the top sellers at a key count like BRU. Now we are comfortably back in the sort of majority of the top seller position, call it the top 10, and feel very good about that and think that's a reflection of all the work we've done on design and the consumer pick up on that.
 That said, I still think there is some general softness in higher price point merchandise for the moment, as we see a lot of strength down at the areas where people are buying single units of things, more opening price point things, they're buying a little less of the match back accessories and things like that, that are very accretive to the overall margin structure. And if you don't sell the main underlying bed set, you probably sell a little less of the accessories.
 If you don't sell the main, higher end crib, you don't sell the various supporting pieces of furniture.

That had only envisioned a single transaction; and we had established a range at the beginning of the year to give us flexibility in going to market with that transaction. That transaction ended up being completed at GBP0.4 billion. So now that guidance has been changed just to the fixed number.
 Then on the unsecured debt side, it is a little bit lower. I think part of that is a function of we have narrowed the guidance as we have moved on to the first half of the year. It is partly a reduced funding requirement; and then we are also mindful of what market conditions look like.
 Right now our liquidity position gives us the opportunity to be opportunistic in our issuance, so we don't anticipate needing to go back to the markets unless the conditions look right for us. Okay. Now, on -- You had another question, Stephanie, about the net obligations to parent? It's the -- It is broken down in note 8, interim accounts.

So I think again, we're on the execution, pay down with opportunities, again, to enhance. We see ourselves in more of a opportunistic mode for our investments. We really don't see gaps as we knit together these different components of the business. Rather we are looking at further enablers to accelerate the growth trajectory, and we're funding all of that out of very strong operating cash flows that still provide, to Dave's point, the ability to meaningfully pay down our debt.

I think that definitely, what I would say though is that price was up a little bit following our model that we've explained a number of times in terms of passing through those raw material costs. And the other part is that we did see a good movement into the export space this past quarter as well. So -- but I'll let Frank dig those splits up, Tim, if you don't mind. Okay. Yes. No, there was no disruption, at least not that we're aware of, I'm going to say on a global choline production scenario. We go in quoting our numbers and we pretty much kind of stick to the margins that we expect to get on the business. Sometimes, we win it; sometimes, we don't. But I would say that there were no extraordinary global issues there that kind of drove that to a higher level than not.
 So I think if anything, maybe some raw material costs had gone up in other parts of the world and they could not be as competitive as they had maybe been in other quarters. But that's a little speculation on my part, but clearly our bid was accepted and we won the business. So that's probably as much insight as I could give on that.",test,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

I think that they are on a dollar basis could have been a step down of 20 to 30 basis points, from negative 1 point something, to negative 2.0 or 2 point something. And I think that most of that is procedure based, Larry. I don't think that across the broader market, we are in a big mix benefit period. I think that there is probably some mix opportunity that some are enjoying, the patient specific instruments in that space is an area that probably most are getting some benefit from, but there aren't a lot of new system launches that would be driving benefits, so I think that your operating environment where pure price is probably minus 2 for most, or at least lower single digits negative, and so that is how we see that space at this point in time.
 With respect to extremities, we continue to do very well with our Trabecular Metal solutions within extremities, so the majority of our business, and the majority of that market at this point in time is shoulder focused, and we have some product portfolio development efforts that are ongoing to address other anatomical sites, and so that is part of the answer for us. And then shoring up our upper extremity offering at the same time is part of the answer for us. But I think that market continues to be healthy, it may have stepped down a bit, but I don't think all that much, I still think on a global basis it is a low double-digit grower, and I think it will continue to be, primarily because there is meaningful innovation going on in that space to provide better solutions for patients than what they have had in past years. So we continue to like the extremities market, and you are going to see us continue to maintain a focus on that market in our product development plans. You are welcome Larry.

So that's what we would expect going forward here. Assuming that raw material costs stay where they're at, that should be some benefit into '012. So in a relatively stable environment, Ajay, what we would normally see is that prices will generally hold. In some cases, we have to provide some price relief if the commodity costs go down; but we generally are able to protect margins better in a declining commodity environment than obviously we are in a rising one.
  Our view at the moment for 2012 on most of these commodities is we'd expect to see a relatively stable environment entering the year, which means that when we do develop our final numbers for 2012, we'd expect to probably see some positive price/cost comps for the year.

4213461_T,1,"{36,38,40}","The pricing equation has never really had all that much to do with the drug price. It has the cost of overall treatment -- when you give an injection, it doesn't matter if it's $2 a Haldol or $30 Abilify, you still have to use restraints, you still have to write the JACO report because you used restraints. You still have to add-mix the injection. The cost of drug almost gets lost in the rounding when you look at the overall health economic equation here. The other drugs that you might have to use with Haldol, for example, Benadryl or the Cogentin to offset the side effects, are also included in the overall health economic story.
  The driver for the success of ADASUVE, while I think it's an easy metric sometimes to look at, is the cost of acquisition for the drug, since in the hospital environment these are per diem reimbursements for these patients. There is a high degree of focus at the overall cost of treatment and the cost of therapy for these patients each day, just not necessarily on specific drug or other sort of components. It's very expensive. One of the push-backs we get from time to time is that generic Haldol is very cheap, and we certainly agree with that. But the cost of layering two more injections plus the Cogentin, especially drives that to be very high. We've heard the high of Cogentin as high as $300 per injection. It really is a multi-factorial analysis that you have to do to look at the cost-effectiveness. The cost of drug's an important consideration, but certainly not the only consideration. Yes. Both patients that are given intramuscular injections and patients that are given oral tablets both are currently monitored, for different reasons. But the monitoring of agitated patients is a very standard procedure, and we don't see that going away. So when we thought about the REMS and having that as, if you will, the first safety net for our REMS beyond the screening of patients, we believe that it's something that is routinely done. We did some market research into hospitals that treat patients and find out that indeed it's very routine. Some hospitals have algorithms of which these patients need to be monitored every 5 minutes, or every 7 minutes, every 10 minutes. It's just what these agitation patients are done.
  Because the agitation may change, they may have had adverse events because the drugs that they were giving, the agitation may continue to escalate if the drug wasn't adequate, or they didn't give enough of it. While it's an important consideration for the REMS that we've submitted, we actually do believe that it's a routine aspect of treating most of these agitated patients in the normal course of their treatment after they get dosed with almost any drug that they get, whether it's an injection or an oral tablet.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

 When you look at the growth rates, for example, which came out from Telia, you can see the same trend, that it's slowing down slightly. So I don't think it's that we are not taking market share or we're losing market share. Where we are normally, we are taking market share towards the competition.
 What we obviously will do, of course, is we will continue -- coming to the second part of the question, we will continue to invest in the OTT strategy, obviously, and we will continue to invest maybe in technology and tech content in order to take market share, particularly on [DTT], which we think is a good target for satellite customers, for example.

4216435_T,1,"{17,19}","Yes let me just explain to you my ideas about this situation. I completely agree with you, your ideas, you know, the Japanese model only grows revenue but with the margin without a robust profit is not a sustainable model. It's actually not in the model I am pursuing so but if we look at the business so I think every few years there is a business cycle, in 2008 seen a financial crunch. Right now we are with the overall economy skidding to another bumpy road so my overall strategy is when the business is in a good year so we will want to get focusing on pursuing the profitability and when we are in a downturn side we have to keep in the marketing here.
 So one thing is clear. I am not just blindly pursuing the market share but in our view it's we are in this environment so the first thing I understand a lot of investor actually requiring -- kind of the requiring need to shrink in the business side just in overall strategy and you can cut off a lot of business. But I want to just explain to you a few things. So letting up on new business or cutting off new business is unlike the buying of disposable -- of selling our stock; it would come down overnight but kind of the either if we give you established business or we dispose of business in or terminate business, normally if we want to implement that strategy it normally takes us three to four quarters to completely give implement so that's the one thing.
 So I am telling you from management is analyzing what's the best strategy so I am listening to what investors, our shareholders' kind of voice, but at this time so we are continuing to -- what we are saying is that demand is still there in the market. It's just that the demand is coming from the blue chip customer and if we take more of that business and it's profitable but not as profitable as if the business is coming from the SMEs.
 So that's the dilemma we are facing at this moment so but if management believes at this moment within our financial shape we will still be able to manage the growth so that's why we keep growing the business and the size and I believe at a certain point in the future when the overall macro situation improves and we might -- we're going to see the significant benefit from this new strategy.

And just to go back to organic growth and think about the fact that we have been growing at double-digit rates for going back eight years now in a market and an industry that is not growing. So I think, again, from a performance perspective, we have outperformed the overall market.
 But specifically to the non-organic areas, we talked about acquisitions in the refrigerant industry. And really in the refrigerant industry, as reflected in our financial results and as we talked about, is somewhat in turmoil relative to valuations. What is the value of cash flows? What is the value of allowances or allocations held? It's very difficult right now to measure.
 There's been lawsuits. There's threats of additional lawsuits. The EPA still has to come out with a rule for 2012. It's a very difficult set of circumstances. And we certainly don't want to make a bad acquisition or a bad decision or a waste of the shareholders' money. So that area of the business has been put on hold in terms of acquisitions, sort of the first of the three prongs outside our organic growth.
 The second is us looking at opportunities to go outside the United States, and for a very reasonable amount of capital, we entered into a joint venture with a company -- two companies actually that have operations in Europe that we helped -- we expect to help jump start that joint venture.
 So we are still looking at those kinds of opportunities in the form of joint ventures or partnerships to expand our reach outside the United States.
 And the last of the three outside of organic growth that we're looking at are sort of ancillary or similar businesses that would utilize our infrastructure or help utilize our infrastructure in the refrigerants and the energy optimization areas and look to grow in that area.

Specifically with wireless carriers, which is an area that we would clearly like to move in to and have more exposure around, so the opportunity to sort of take client A on one handset and transmit a video call across our network to handset B with a disparate client on it, we think it is a pretty unique opportunity. It's things like that, where we can create a solution that resides on the network and take advantage of that, and create a recurring revenue stream.

I think you've got to look over the long term. I think as you go into 2012, I think you'll start to see that turn back to where it was and I also believe with the amount of customers that we have and one of the sockets we're designed into, as long as those sockets are successful with those customers you should see that share rebound and if not increase in the short-term in 2012.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

We don't generally break down and talk about how much we have actually allocated towards e-commerce. I would say we were probably a little underallocated at this point last year, so we are trying to strategically build that inventory to support the growth in the business, which Matt indicated has been at about 40% growth each of the quarters of this year. And then again, we brought in some of our holiday assortment a little bit earlier, so that we are ready for what we expect to be a good holiday gift-giving season.
  In terms of the fourth quarter, again we don't generally provide guidance on inventory. I would say as I look ahead, I think the quality in the content of inventory is going to be as good as it is now and as clean as we're experiencing coming into the fourth quarter. And, Kimberly, the other thing I would add to that is the fact that with the new categories that we have really focused on adding, which are providing incremental sales, the personal care that has a very long shelf life on those items and inventory, the new watches, the shoe assortment. We are increasing inventory. There is a pipeline still associated with that along with just incremental inventory, because we think these could be big growth categories for us, with relatively little risk from an inventory standpoint in those accessory areas that we are funding additional dollars toward because we think there is big upside for the business in those areas.",train,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE

It's up relative to where it's been in the first half of last year.
  Our gold balances at our stores, pawn loan balances at our stores in the first quarter, 71% of aggregate US balances compared to 70% last year. So we continue to see a lot of gold jewelry coming in as collateral. Outstanding jewelry loans are up 10% in the US business and new loans written are up 7% in the US business in the first quarter. That's on a same-store basis. So I mean I think we're still seeing a strong level of jewelry loans. I wouldn't and of course we're significantly up year over year.

  The front end vision remains the same, thinking about G-2 and consolidated front end to platform consolidation. Obviously in an industry like ours where scale is key consolidation is nothing but a good thing. We are, as I mentioned, in answer to your previous question, we are migrating volume to G-2 as we speak. We migrated the majority of the volume for one of our largest customers over the last quarter or so.
  We are also boarding new merchants to G-2 as we speak. In fact, one of the items in Q4 that drived such a such big Q4 for us is some large sales that are coming live in the US in that Q4 time frame, those will be boarded to G-2.
  Now as I said earlier, we're selectively doing this based on functionality, which platforms are ready for which customers, whether it is a migration or new, so we're still boarding -- we still have many customers on the legacy mainframe platforms. We continue to work on all the things we talked about the last few quarters, the requirements we need for any existing customers, the right sequencing of migrations which as you know involves a conversation with the merchants themselves. They have work to do and that's participate in the testing so we're trying to roll all that out thoughtfully in a planful manner and no longer predict or promise to you which volumes or which percentage win, but again we continue to make very nice progress, incremental progress in terms of being thoughtful and pragmatic about how we drive the front end strategy in the US and then eventually globally.",train,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE

I think the Byrne numbers -- they have a different makeup, obviously. We have amortization that's adding to G&A. Their selling expense is quite a bit higher than the average, just because of the way we run that sales team. I think where we are now are probably good estimates for where we will be going forward. Well, again, there's several things. We have some aggressive marketing campaigns and promotional campaigns to try to offset just relatively low growth, for example, in the Healthcare Disposables business, so those are programs. We have -- we are -- I think we can now reach the full complement of additional salespeople that we were going to put in Byrne, but only really just completing that now. I see a -- we also have on the books, and we're now recruiting a couple of sales positions to help grow our international business in a couple of areas in China, in Europe, across multiple businesses. These are two and three and four people at a time, so they do -- it's not huge investments, but they do add up, but we think those are good investments to be making.

  You're right to assume that unless those products declined they can't create a decline in operating earnings. What I would say is, first of all, our specialty disposables, which is our respiratory disposables business, actually did decline quarter over quarter and we did see margin pressure in those businesses. In addition, we were investing in parts of those businesses, improving -- making process improvements around sourcing and process improvements in manufacturing in combination with that.
  So those are the things that drove down gross margins and ultimately operating margins on that side of the business. So, again, those small changes -- small absolute-dollar changes can make a large difference, and the business doesn't descale well because it is relatively small. So the loss of those higher-margin products had a very big impact on the overall P&L for the segment. Great, next question.",test,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
4684923_T,1,"{12,13,15,16}","Don't get me wrong, Brian, to correct -- [time prices] has pushed back on yields. Remember, yield is still rising into the first two quarters. It is rising off a significantly higher base compared to last year.
 I don't see any particular pushback. I think where we are concerned is as you get into the 5 to 10 days out, you may not be getting that same very strong late yield performance we were seeing last year. But we did have a dip between Easter and peak summer last year as well.
 I am on the -- I think at the moment we plan to be conservative. We do have a number of markets where we have put in a huge amount of additional capacity, most notably Budapest where we have five aircraft. And yes, Malev went bust and closed, but that's still an awful lot of capacity out of the blocks for us and at one airport.
 We have a five airport aircraft base opening up in Palma de Mallorca. We have put four extra aircraft into main Barcelona airport.
 And we have the equivalent of about three aircraft going into Modlin in Poland on the 16th of July, or in Warsaw, but they're not actually based there. So we have a lot -- last year, where we had a lot of the incremental capacity going on existing -- adding at existing bases, this year we are adding capacity at new bases.
 In terms of the nonfuel cost, I think at the moment we are expecting this year that it will be flat excluding fuel, plus or minus the sector length. At the moment, again, until the winter schedule is finalized I think we should plan sector length will be slightly down, flat to slightly down. So we expect nonfuel cost to be flat to very slightly down in the next 12 months. I might also mention that from this morning I have seen a few reports where I think a few people got the wrong end of the stick, where they were talking about 10% yields in Q1. I think what we said it would be potentially mid-single-digit yields in Q1 rather than the normal double-digit. So I don't know; there's a few reports circulating there which I was just reading on the way out. And the airport charges, we said they would be broadly flat. We don't really see any increase in airport charges. Remember, the proposed Spanish increases -- or it's Spanish, it's an airport tax. When you come off the -- well it'd come off the average fares, and off the yields, rather than be added as a cost.

4684977_T,1,"{3,4,5,6}","Okay. Is this still on? So, Tim, in the gearbox, that's good. Look, we have previously guided, Tim, that we need to have a look at Kolomela's costs in 2013 compared to Sishen's costs in 2013, and at that stage Kolomela's costs will be slightly lower than Sishen. So the ramp-up in Sishen's costs has been very consistent with what we've expected. The waste mining, we'll see a big kick in the second half of this year with waste mining, but we should get better production. So we should see this 21% increase in costs, maybe a little bit more than that, but not too much more than that figure.
 So that will -- so that's in line with what we've guided, and I think the expectation is that that will be the unit cost for the whole of this year. That will take us into 2013. And we said at 2013 then Kolomela will be at full production, and then that's the time to compare us to Sishen's costs, and Kolomela will be slightly lower than that on the mine.
 Now, the Sishen unit cost graph, we just gave a picture of where Kolomela is now, but there is still quite a bit of cost coming through in the second half of this year. There is still additional employees to be brought on board. So we've always said don't look too closely at Kolomela's costs this year. We were expecting much higher costs, of course, as the production would have been lower.
 So the faster we can bring in the production, which is exactly what Aart and his team are doing, and are certainly aiming for much higher numbers than the 4m to 5m and we're already seeing that come through. That's why we are seeing already some lower costs this year. So it was expected to be much higher, production is better, therefore the costs are lower.
 But Kolomela, don't -- because there will be higher costs coming through in the second half of this year, don't worry too much around the Kolomela costs. Compare this in 2013.
 On the Kolomela capital -- and there's a couple of things around the capital. So whilst the cash flow has flowed at ZAR7.5b, some of what work has already taken place, some of the -- it takes a while for some of the cash to flow. So it's not all on those three outstanding items that I mentioned. So I mentioned that we still have 260 houses to build. We are not building more houses than we said we are going to build. So we've already built 450, I think, Francois, and we are going to build another 260.
 So it's in line with what we've said. We are not all of a sudden building a new Postmasburg. But some of the -- so some of the cash will go on the houses, some of it on mining equipment still to come. We still have drills and trucks and things to come. And then some of it, as we still ramp up, we've still got some redesign of things like some of the stackers and some of the sampling at the plant needs some work. So you expect to see some of those numbers.
 A little bit early for us to say if we are coming in under budget. So those three items, cash still got to flow; some of the stuff that's already happened, that cash flow coming through. But we are not going to be above our ZAR8.5b CapEx.
 I don't know, Francois, anything else to add to that? (Inaudible - microphone inaccessible). And lump premium, Timo, do you want to tackle lump premium? Sure. Lump premium is stabilizing. It's not as strong as it was last year, but it's still very meaningful. We are seeing a lump premium of about $11, $12 per tonne in our traditional markets, Japan, Korea and Europe. The lump premium in China is a bit weaker than that. It's about $6 or $7 per tonne. But it's been stable at that level for some time now.
 That is the premium purely for sizing. If you look at the difference between the prices we realize on our fines and our lump, it's a little bit higher than that. And that's because also included there is a difference in Fe content of -- I think it's about 0.8% difference between our lump and our fines.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

I'd say the third quarter will be close to the second. I don't think you're going to see the full impact. Where you're really going to see it is when you get into the fourth quarter because the problem with the current quarter is you are really not getting any production out of Canada right now, whereas when you get to the fourth quarter, not only will you have the US fully online but you'll have Canada online also. Well they can't grow during the winter months up in Canada because of the lack of sun. And that was one of the many reasons they came to Santa Maria, California.

4690776_T,1,"{51,52,53,54,55}","We are not sure about that. We don't make the call on whether pricing is going to go up or down. We speculate ourselves. We talk internally about that. Business conditions are flat. It's the fourth quarter, there's less billing days, less shipping days.
 So price increases, we haven't seen the raw material prices goes up, iron ore. It is speculated that next month scrap will go up $10 to $20, maybe even $30 a ton, we think more $10 to $20, personally. That's not going to move the needle very much. So we just think prices are going to pretty much stay where they are, plus or minus $10 to $20 a ton. You have to remember also, Richard, from a LIFO perspective, obviously we carry many different products and some can go up a little, some can go down a little, so we've got to look across that. And another factor is the timing lag of when a mill announces the price increase, when that takes effect and we receive the material into our inventory, and that results in overall pricing effect within our inventory levels. We are projecting to what we have, our costs in inventory as of December 31 from a LIFO standpoint. And with respect to the quarter, I think we are more positive on pricing in this fourth quarter than we were telling you three months ago in July. I think in July we had anticipated that pricing was going to be, in general, trending downward during the quarter. We were wrong in that it went down, particularly in carbon, prices went down more than we had anticipated. Certainly stainless and aluminum continued to go down because of the LME and the nickel surcharges.
 So price softness in the third quarter was actually much worse than we anticipated and we are more positive on pricing this quarter really because we think it's going to be relatively flat, as Gregg -- on an average -- as Gregg pointed out. With maybe a slight bias on the upside on carbon and aluminum probably flattish and stainless maybe a little bit higher because of the surcharge here in October and November.
 So overall, I think the challenge with the fourth quarter is, like Karla said, there is a huge impact on the number of shipping days. If you count the available shipping days in the fourth quarter, I think it comes up to 62. But practically speaking, because of the day after Thanksgiving, or the day before Christmas, the 31st, which is technically a shipping day of December, those aren't really shipping days. In our planning, we are looking at a number of shipping days at about 56 or 57, not an effective number of shipping days as opposed to the technical number of 62.
 If you think about the fourth quarter that way, you can see that we are really not anticipating a fall off in sales. We're looking at pricing relative to the third quarter in a much better way than I think we did for the third quarter. Overall, the fourth quarter will be fine. It's just a real challenge because of the number of shipping days. I think, Richard, in the last call at that time there had been some carbon price increases because there were anticipated potential strikes at some of the carbon mills, so there was a little more up momentum so to speak out there. And obviously, we all know what happened there and at that time we also were thinking that we might have a fourth-quarter price increases coming in the way we did last year and the prior year. I think with the things Dave talked earlier, all the marco and US uncertainty, that we are not sure that we are going to get that same bump up in prices that we got the last two years. As Gregg mentioned earlier, too, about the pricing in the fourth quarter, it's hard to have those things stick and even if they are announced, usually they don't have much of an impact on the fourth quarter itself. Those higher prices don't usually arrive until the first quarter, even though maybe material is being ordered at higher prices in the fourth quarter.

Scott recently redid our own credit facilities, which has a pretty broad syndicate in there, so we were firsthand getting knowledge from people that we have had long relationships with -- how they are thinking about risk inside their own companies. And we have seen a pullback by many of these continental European banks.
  There was a void in the market, it seemed like, in the -- I don't know, the third quarter or so -- but we are now more recently, in the fourth quarter and into this year, we are seeing new entrants come in.

4693280_T,1,{13},"It is a tough question, Davies. I think obviously the dividend and the payout model that we have evolved out of our structure as a trust. And I think when we got into the trust structure, arguably it was a more tax efficient way for the organization to continue to move forward. At the time we converted to a trust, corporate tax rates were 40% levels, and by obviously flowing income out to individual shareholders we were able to overall enjoy a lower tax rate than that corporate rate, and so it made good sense.
 And it also created a lot of capital discipline. We would pride ourselves that we already have the capital discipline to allocate capital well, as you suggest, but when your back's against the wall you always become better. And when you have got limited capital to work with, I think everybody even at Peyto would agree that we make better choices with what to do with that capital.
 So when we converted back to a corporation we had lots of opportunity to put capital to work. As you suggest, the horizontal well technology and our drilling inventory has really exploded, and there is a lot of opportunity to put that capital to work, and so we did cut back the payout quite a bit at the time.
 And our expectation was that we were going to deliver more return to shareholders in the form of growing assets and reinvesting cash flow than the yield piece was really going to give them. That was more of a smaller complementary bit. So our dividend policy was really to leave the dividend where it was and to grow our asset base and to grow our cash flows.
 If we were in I guess a normal natural gas price environment right now, we would have much higher gas prices and we'd have much higher cash flows, and that whole payout ratio would continue to shrink over time, becoming on an ongoing basis a smaller and smaller part of the total return we are delivering to shareholders.
 But holding that flexibility, having that capital discipline, being able to dividend some money back to shareholders, I think a lot of shareholders still enjoy that. They still like the fact that they are getting paid perhaps to wait for some natural gas price recovery. They are getting paid in the short-term here to wait for us to get even more active and put more capital to work.
 But you're right, I mean as we move forward we do have a lot of great opportunities to invest in, and so we have a lot of competition for that capital right now, and that is something that the Board has to constantly consider.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

You saw GBP900-odd-million in PBT for RBB Africa. We're over GBP1 billion if you look at all Africa, including what's happening in Wealth, what's happening in Bar Cap. So that's why I say two different numbers. I think you're saying, can RBB Africa be over GBP1 billion, right? Maria, did you -- were you able to connect, I hope? Yes, Bob. I'm on the line. Can you hear me? Yes, perfectly. Thank you. Great. Yes, I think that's absolutely right. In total, actually, PBT is closer to GBP1.3 billion. So GBP908 million of that is in RBB, but if you add back cards, which is about GBP233 million, which has seen strong growth for the last year, that's also been a very big contributor to the numbers.
  I think, going forward, we do see good strong opportunity for growth across the business, so across RBB, across card and, in fact, across Corporate. So I think we are looking for good growth on the income side.
  We've also seen good progress on the cost side. So, for last year, we saw costs down 1% in the business, both across -- across the entire spectrum, so the whole of Africa including Absa. And we've seen strong improvements in impairments. So impairments are down 17% for the region. So I think this is a good story going forward as well, so we expect to see contribution to PBT strong in the year ahead. One of the things we're finding so exciting about this is the more time you spend in Africa, you realize the incredible connection between what's going on in Africa with China and India directly. And it's not, as we traditionally thought, going through New York and going through London. It's really a direct trade relationship.
  And it gives us a real competitive advantage even here in the UK, as John Winter would tell you, that the UK businesses are increasingly having trade relationships not just with Europe, but also with Africa.
  So we think it's pretty exciting. It's one of the fastest-growing regions in the world from a GNP point of view as well, which is -- it's nice to have that position in an area with above developed economy growth.
  Antony, on the deposit question? Thank you, Maria. Well, Chris, on deposits, of course it's quite competitive out there in the marketplace as people seek funding and seek funding relative to their other choices in terms of cost. But actually, as you'll see in our numbers, our numbers of savings accounts increased significantly and our overall deposits increased 3% which, I think, is a fantastic performance in a very challenging market.
  And the way we've been able to do that is, firstly, because we focus on the customer and the customer relationship, and secondarily, because we've been able to launch innovative products, like our flexible bond where customers can take a proportion of the money out of the bond even before it expires.
  So this is about how we compete day in and day out on the high street; the quality of our people, the quality of our products, the quality of our brand.

And so we are a big direct seller there. That market there was, for four out of six years, it was our country of the year. So we have a big and profitable business there.
  Very interesting, the economic crisis in the world that most of the world saw in 2008 -- it was delayed by about a year there and particularly in the minerals -- so much of the economy is based on that in Western Australia where truck drivers were making $150,000 a year. That fell apart in 2009 and 2010. And so that's been a wind in our face there. So Australia, New Zealand is -- we are all over it and we have made the changes. But the other owned piece of that is the Japanese business and you know what happened in Japan this past year. But before that we had issues, but they were problems I believe of our own making. Mike would you pick up on that? Absolutely. So we made a strategic choice in Japan over the last couple years really to emphasize houseware products, yet still include some third-party source products as we have in the past. But instead of being in a more diverse category mix it's more, closer to home. We are also working on and being successful at building more of a selling culture there and we did that through how we set the standards for our sales force, what you need to do to qualify under promotional plans and triple rewards, things like that. We're starting to see some benefits of that but that is a slow build kind of a thing. So I wouldn't say that there is a one-off there as much as we are executing on a transformation that is still in the fairly early stages.
  Australia, I think is just as Rick mentioned, it was a tough quarter there both because of the externals and waiting for some of the things that we are doing to really kick in. There, it is things like lowering the barriers for the sales force to come and we've got a very highly trained sales force and leadership sales force, leadership group in that market.

So when overall year-on-year salaries increased by more close to 11% than what we negotiated with the union. This year we expect salaries increase to be much lower than what happened in last year, probably be due inflation plus one, plus one and a half, no more than that. Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen, just a question regarding margins. There was a nice improvement particularly in Deca to I guess 26%, 27%. And it's coming up a long way since the consolidation of Elizabeth. How far -- how much higher do you expect to be able to bring up the margins on the Deca side? Hi, Ricardo. Thank you for your question. We have to remember that this margin reflects already the price increases that we implemented in the end of 2011, and with regard to additional cost pressure only salary increases in the metal fitting segment.
 My guess since we do not have a this present moment any other price increases scheduled for the year at the present moment again, and we expect some inputs to grow at least in line with inflation probably this margin will not repeat in the coming quarters. Probably it will reduce a little bit, but on the positive side what I can tell you is that we have product mix improvement in the Elizabeth segment.
 Probably it's like the second quarter this year we will be able to achieve already 50% of the output capacity of that plant already in a better market segment that we had in 2011, on the negative side inflation plus the commencement of the new plant in [Caymados] more toward the end of the year.
 You know that to start a refute we have to hire people. We have to buy raw materials in order to start running the plants. And in the beginning, you have some inefficiencies in terms of margins -- operating margins. So all of that will be seen during the course of the year. Okay? Fair enough? And [Caymados] is in the fourth quarter, or third quarter? At the end of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter. Okay. And just one other question then, are you still seeing pressure from foreign competitors on the Deca product line? Well pressure per se we haven't had. What we have are seeing is a threat, a threat that on the third and FX level is lower than the threat we saw in 2011. And this is one of the reasons why we were able to increase prices but also 7% during the fourth quarter. We still -- we are still following very close the movement of these foreign players in the export market, but we haven't seen anything that cause our attention -- shows dramatic change in consuming patterns or even in the import level.

4705492_T,1,{3},"Pedro, thank you very much for participating in our call, and thank you for your question. Evolution of our revenues, the growth in our revenues has been a challenge for the Company. We have been delivering an important growth, if you consider year-on-year. Nevertheless, as you said yourself, it is below what we ourselves expected after the investments that we made and the acquisitions that we made and the whole sales structure that we implemented.
 What I can say is that we have major challenges. In Topz, we lost market share at Topz, and we made the business profitable, but on the other hand, we lost market share and we lost some important clients, and also clients that didn't have an adequate profitability, that is to say we were not able to recover the volume and the revenues as we estimated before and we are operating below our plan and we have quite a few challenges ahead of us so that we may have a rebound and reach the levels that we expected to reach in Embramed products.
 When you start your comparison year-on-year, the third quarter of 2011 was a time when we had already consolidated a major part of the Embramed revenue, so the year-on-year comparison starts to incorporate all the M&A activities of last year because the third quarter of 2011 had a big participation of P. Simon and Embramed as well. But undoubtedly, we do have a challenge in the hospital segment, and in terms of accelerating our revenue stream, similarly to the consumer area of our company and thereby reaching a volume and the operational leverage that we intend to reach.
 And there are quite a few reasons involved. We could mention the fact that we have not been able to increase volume and increasing profitability, so it is a rather complex issue and the challenges are bigger than the ones that we had anticipated before in terms of executing our cross-selling strategy, and capturing commercial synergies with these two companies. So we do have a big challenge there in terms of accelerating our sales according to our plan, and we will have to tackle this from now on.
 In the latex platform, what we have, especially gloves, surgical gloves and examination gloves, this is a major part of our market share. We recovered quite a lot but it is still lagging behind what we expected and what we imagined would happen.
 Looking ahead, we will continue to try and accelerate our growth but be more cautious in this regard, and really very much aware of the fact that the challenges are bigger than we anticipated. And we are working to improve the efficiency of our sales team and our value chain and their reduction of stock-outs and despite of the fact that we do have a high inventory now, we still have to improve the availability of the right products at the right place.
 Regarding our revenues, the challenge is bigger than we anticipated to reach the levels that we expected and of not growing revenues as quickly as we expected, and not obtaining the same operating leverage that we expected. And all of that has a very big impact on our expenses, which are high for the operations that we have today, and therefore the margins and the EBITDA results are lower than we expected ourselves.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

I don't know. But it should be within that 70% to 75% range. Now, bear in mind also -- and that's why we show the three lines of insurance combined -- namely, workers' comp, general liability, and the commercial automobile -- together, in total.

4708106_T,1,{20},"What we see is -- so, first of all, I think we are undergoing the final times of the short -- the short-term signals are switched. They are switched because you have an artificial balance, the official deck of many assets that will not start or go into operation. So when you see that the distributor is over supplied or over contracted this is not true. Because it's based on a gas, it's not going to happen. So this will show up, will emerge in six months, a year, year and a half, when you see the elastic turning very strongly to the side of the contract.
 I don't work with short-term signals. I work with medium- and long-term signals, a growth that I imagine to be 4 megawatts or 5 gigawatts per year to support the growth projected for Brazil.
 Another thing that will also accelerate this -- these contracts is that what has been supporting the growth in Brazil from the perspective of power and energy is the small industry and the emergence of these new markets. So we are beating consumption records. The industry has not shown its face yet. The day the industry starts operating and Brazil really grows in this area I think the train will leave the station and will no longer come back. So you will see the elastic provoking a very important hike in terms of contracts.
 So our take is that if you're going to contract 1,000, 2,000 this year, or 5,000 or 6,000 next year, this doesn't matter. In a two-year horizon the total amount is already set. At some point we're going to do the write off of this capacity. Industry will pick up again. You cannot grow a company only with power plants without reservoirs.
 Today we have 120 plus 60 insured that's above load. This leads to a high volatility of prices, going from BRL10 to BRL140 in a given month. So this is not robust in the long term. This has to be corrected one way or another. So what I usually say is from our 10 gigawatts I don't know what is going to come first.
 I don't know if coal is going to come this year, or gas, or wind, but everything will have to go into the grid. I have no doubt about that, because this volatility cannot be withstand. You cannot have a situation where in one month you have rain and the price goes up to BRL150. No. This has to be changed. So my take is -- you ask how will I grow. Well, in a scenario of fewer contracts, as apparently it's going to be this year, I have two possibilities to grow.
 Either I have the most competitive projects in the market and I'll have my last megawatt going into the plot that's going to be contracted, and I think this is the case. If I get more gas for Parnaiba I'm going to bid and I'm going to win. Nobody can beat us in terms of competitiveness. Much more now that we have 2,000 megawatts our incremental capacity is absolutely competitive. Everything in terms of infrastructure, the development for production, everything is already planned for it, so we are competitive due to the assets of our projects, which places us in a scenario even -- competitive even in low contracts.
 And due to the reasons I explained I think Brazil will require more demand in renewable or in thermal and it will be open for negotiation. This will also lead to growth for us. So competitiveness in our portfolio added to the level of assets that we are going to see in the medium run make us confident that we are going to reach the mid-term target of 20 megawatts for the joint venture.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
4709157_T,1,"{3,4}","Okay, in respect of the cost development, Q1, year on year, development cost is, of course, the CHF65 million, which is on a separate line. Furthermore, if you look at the year-on-year comparison you do see that the investment in the growth initiatives which were building up during the course of the year 2011, had a full impact in Q1, 2012.
 I wouldn't say that we have, furthermore, one-off costs; maybe a CHF4 million/CHF5 million one-off cost, but not material in that respect. Strict cost management resulting in, as far as possible, a recruitment stop, the decision has been taken two weeks ago, and we watch very much -- and Reinhard is very pushing that as well -- we watch very much reaching the productivity target, as well as protecting the service level to the customer.
 How quickly will this be implemented? We will see, at the end of Q2, I assume, the first impact on that. To quantify that is very difficult at this moment. Just to add on, as I mentioned before, we also now have in front of us the implementation of our new IT system in Airfreight and Seafreight, and we are pushing very much to start on time, and this creates, until we start, additional spending in IT.
 And basically, how we want to achieve the cost management, of course we already reduced, earlier this year, our travel expenses. And you may remember this is, in our industry, quite heavy, because we are a service industry, and sitting in front of customers very frequently. So [decreased] costs in administration and corporate, or even decrease wherever possible.
 So we have set targets for productivity in all business units, and on a monthly basis these targets will be reviewed. And if we cannot achieve them, there will be not only employment stops, but also reduction in staff, if necessary.
 So saying all of this, of course, we still push growth, but on the other side after all the heavy investment in field sales -- and I mentioned this in our annual conference, that we have now the tools to evaluate the performance, which was always very difficult in our industry. So that will lead to a reduction of non-performers in our field sales [population].
 As Gerard mentioned, we will see the results in a couple of months. On the other side, one has to be very careful -- and we're watching this of course -- how real is the recovery in the second half. So we have to watch this very carefully.
 Different to 2009, this is also worthwhile mentioning, that we basically had a, let's say, global crisis, a similar development all over the world. And this time, the economic environment is different from region to region. For instance, South America and Middle East are still doing well; here and there above budget. And also, our Central Europe region, which is Germany and Benelux and Switzerland, is doing well. So that makes it a little bit more difficult; it needs to be more individual attention to do the necessary measurements.
 But as I said, we are quite confident with cost management; cost reduction on one side. And [with our] solid growth and outperforming the market, we're looking forward to improvements in the second half of this year.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
4709863_T,1,"{3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}","Okay, if I take the first one on loan growth, we've seen loan growth in the last two quarters of about 4%. We are expecting that degree of loan growth, for 2012, in the region of 3%, 4%, 5% to continue. The pipeline is a positive one and we think that is achievable.
 On the investment properties, Surya, do you want to take that? I'll take that over. The bulk of what you see as investment properties in our subsidiary the Emirates Islamic Bank, and they have a model where most of these properties are let out and are income generating.
 What you see in the financial statements is clearly the result of valuation. Nonetheless, these are income generating and we are quite comfortable that as and when the market [relates] itself, these properties should come back over time but, in the meantime, they are not a drag in terms of a cost of carry, because these are assets that are performing.
 On liquidity, to some extent it's something we do on a day-to-day basis in our treasury, and something we do on a longer-term basis in our Asset Liability Committee. At quarter three we saw the spike in the margins and that was more because IBOR fell and the loan rates hadn't re-set themselves just as fast.
 You have seen some of that loan re-setting happening in quarter four. That will continue into Q1 of this year, so the so-called super profit, if you want to call it, will disappear over the few quarters. But we have been good at managing the liabilities side of the equation and if you look, year over year the overall balance sheet for loans and deposits came down 2011 over 2010.
 Nonetheless, net interest income has gone significantly higher than 2010, and that's really bringing down the price of deposits. There are two components to this. We do not wish to be bidding for deposits in the wholesale market, because that's self-defeating across the banking sector. And if somebody else, if any of our competitors want to pay more for it, I'd say good luck to them.
 And we have shied away from these deposits, specifically in Q3 and Q4 of this year. That's been more than made up with the growth in Retail deposits and year over year we have grown stable deposits by over AED10b, and that's a strategy that will continue into 2012.
 Having said that, we haven't stopped just with Retail deposits; we did renew the Sukuk. Let's also not forget that the AED2.8b funds we got from the UAE Ministry of Finance, as part of the Dubai Bank acquisition, sits on our balance sheet at relatively cheap rates.
 So you will see some movement, but we do expect to see that high number contracting to a more sustainable level, and we think 250 bps is sustainable in this market. Whether we get to it in one quarter or four quarters is something that the market will determine, and we will have to manage through our daily and periodic processes.
 On capital I'll just make one comment before I hand over to Ben for a more detailed explanation. We do pay dividends every year, and that hasn't stopped our capital from growing or remaining at this level. So the fact that we have to pay dividends after the AGM this year will get more than offset by any profits we make during the course of the year.
 And that's a cycle that plays itself out every year.
 On the other part, Ben, you can pick it up? Not too much to add to that, to be honest. Yes, we have some Tier 1 perpetual notes from ICD that do take about a percent off that. If you were to exclude that from Tier 1, clearly it is eligible for Tier 1, so we include it. But, as Surya was saying, the dividend will be replenished through retained earnings generation, so we are pretty comfortable with these levels of capitalization.
 Before we go to the next question on the floor I have two questions from the webcast as well. I'll read those out. The first one is from Naresh Bilandani from JPMorgan, and the question is given that you mentioned you are targeting acquisitions in Turkey and KSA, and given that DenizBank in Turkey is already in the news for sale by Dexia, are you potential bidders for this asset, by any chance?
 And the second part is can you guide if Egypt would be of acquisition interest for you as well? Yes, I think, Naresh, just to answer that, we are not -- there is nothing specific on our horizons at the moment (technical difficulty) and the bits in between. And that's always been the focus in terms of inorganic opportunities. We understand, obviously, the European banks and a lot of others are selling assets and opportunities will arise. There's nothing specific on the horizon at the moment. That -- and includes, sorry, the Egypt? Any acquisitions in the (multiple speakers). And that includes -- Egypt's obviously within the geography that we are looking at, of interest. This is our area of expertise, GCC, Middle East, but no specific items are on our desk, but we continue to see if there is anything that is out there and continues to -- opportunities will continue to be out there over the next few months, we are sure, that would fit in our business model. But there's nothing at the moment. The second question from the webcast, from [Emi al Riahobia], Sorry Emi if I've pronounced that wrong, from UBS. Do you expect to issue any Eurobonds in the next 12 months? I think, yes, the answer to that is yes. Obviously Surya has already outlined in terms of our appetite for more medium-term debt, so that will be a focus. We've done a successful sukuk issue already. That will be a continuing program, both using our EMTN program in other areas to raise medium-term debt at effective, efficient pricing that we consider to be efficient.
 We are looking at a target of about $2.5b, or so, this year. So -- but again, looking at the cash flows that we've got, as Surya said, those cash flows in terms of repayments are manageable, but we are looking at the medium-term part of our balance sheet where we need to grow our term funding.

 We do want to build value into these product candidates before they are out of Compugen; but this is in line with what we said previously in the Pipeline Program and the stages that we have described for the Pipeline Program. So nothing that we plan to leave in Compugen for further development beyond the Pipeline Program for now. Yes, just the aspect of talking about the building additional capabilities for monoclonal antibodies was not meant to -- that we were going to long-term keep these products in-house. But it is clear to us that we will have substantially greater value and opportunity in licensing out the monoclonal antibodies rather than the targets.
 Now, I don't want to say that we will not license our targets. We actually are having some discussions now; they are at a very early stage, but there we do have some very, very interesting targets.
 But it is difficult for me to imagine that we would get the type of financial rewards for a target that we would get for a successful monoclonal antibody. We are in this very, very unique situation in our industry that -- the shareholders aren't going to like what I'm about to say -- but we can accept failures.
 You see so many small life science companies out there, they can't accept failures They are resting on one or two products. As a matter of fact, some of the big pharmaceutical companies are in a difficult position to accept failures, because so much of their future rests on one or two products.
 We can accept failures. With the number of targets that we -- how many have we disclosed to date? Or have we disclosed? I don't know, about -- maybe -- well, let me just say it's in double figures. If you want to add to that you can. Okay, not.
 In any event, we have got -- and these are targets that look very good and have gone through a series of validation steps, so the -- and the process of going from a target to a monoclonal antibody is largely technical in nature.

I assumed what you meant when you said G&A was just our expenditures in general, because whatever we do with -- Well, with our R&D expense and also our G&A, we did not expect any increase in the G&A. Right. I think for -- you know, for those of us -- for those of you who have followed us over the years, I think it is clear that we are both very careful with respect to our expenditures, and we also are very good. And Dikla and her team does an excellent job of projecting what our expenditures will be and then controlling the expenditures in the Company.
 Something that people may not be aware of, but I think might surprise some of our shareholders, that if you look over the last what -- four years, five years? Four years. If you look over the last four years, each year we have ended with more cash in the bank than we did the year before. And I doubt if you can say -- and this is without any large offerings or any of this kind of stuff. We've been protecting the shareholders' interests, and we have been -- we're a development stage company with almost no revenues.
 And yet, as I said, each year for the last four years we have ended the year with more cash than we did the year before. I don't think -- I am fairly certain this year will be no exception. Thank you for asking. My big fear in these calls is that no one will ask questions.
 We have nothing to hide as a Company. We are who we are. So feel free to ask any type -- don't feel uncomfortable with any type of question. Well, I did prepare some remarks; but in view of my very long answers to a few questions, I think I will conclude this just by thanking all of you for being on the call.
 I would like to tell people who happen to be in New York or are on the East Coast that Anat will be speaking at the Bio CEO conference on Monday, February 13; so if you would like to hear her or meet her in person, that would be a good opportunity to do so.
 So, again, in closing I thank you. Since I mentioned the fact that I have been the Chairman here since 1997, I think I should also add that I don't think I have ever been prouder of anything that I have done in my professional career than being associated with this Company. It is a marvelous team of people, and I believe we are really going to change the world of pharmaceuticals. It's a real pleasure to be here and to work with these people. So thank you very much.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
4721946_T,1,{22},"Yes, I do think that 2% to 3% on the computer itself, is what I think, but as we think about the regional side, we are still going to probably be seeing negative utilization numbers greater than, say, the 2% or 3%, because you're going to be seeing the rates on that area going up extremely nicely on the rate side.
 So we're really -- on the regional side, we're strictly looking on revenue per truck, and utilization may get down say to negative 7%, and if rates get up to 10% or 12%, for a positive 3% or 4%. That's kind of our thought processes on that.

Since that time, we have had some pretty nice momentum again in terms of opportunity funnel and pipeline.

When you first start a Company like this, you are very, very hesitant to invest in products that you're not going to see any revenue for five or six years. We've crossed that barrier and now we're very, very focused on sustainability.

4725629_T,1,{44},"Yes, and I'll address the second part of that first. In terms of the housing market, I think we're starting to see some improvement in the housing market, but it's very, very slow. And there's some questions about how it's going to progress given foreclosure levels and all that, but the biggest component of our asphalt sales really isn't on the house related to construction of new communities and support of the housing market. The vast majority of our demand is really on the paving side, the building of new roads, the preservation of existing roads.
  And so we look at -- first of all, we mentioned in our comments that we see that this is slowly improving and we're hearing from the states that they're trying to push additional money into the whole road repair and construction effort both from an economic activity standpoint, but also you have this pent-up demand. Eventually, we're going to have to fix the roads.
  When we look at the markets, we're going to be getting into the asphalt season here within the next few months, and we're seeing, first of all, the California, West Coast economy is improving now. And I saw some data recently that indicated that, in fact, the West Coast economy may today be improving at a faster rate than nearly any other part of the country.
  We've seen, in terms of -- they're still working through their budgets in California, but what's proposed is a budget of about $4 billion to do this work out in California in this year, and that's a fairly significant increase over what we've seen over the last couple years. So assuming that budget out there gets approved, that's pushing additional money into road construction repair and will impact asphalt demand on the West Coast.
  West Texas, the demand has been very good, and we've seen leadings increase between, year-over-year, well I think last year at this time, we had about 70,000 tons of leadings. We're up to 110,000 tons, so far this year, an increase of 36%. So Texas, we are seeing pretty good evidence of -- that will support increased demand.
  So overall, we feel good about this, and we feel it's heading in the right direction. In terms of what we're planning and budgeting for, we don't think that we're going to return to the levels that we saw in 2006-2007. Demand sits -- between that period and today is off 40%. But we do think that we can directionally move to increase demand in the asphalt business, and we like our position in the asphalt business, so we think we'll benefit from that.",test,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
4726288_T,1,{20},"Yes I was mentioning, clearly that's the primary payload that we are working on right now and has the most potential really long-term business potential as well as just a business case really plays out very well for us. So that is clearly our primary mission. There are still several other, what I would call supporting missions that sort of fill around the edges that are being worked to, that still fit within the overall payload, power and other aspects of the payload budget. I don't think those will probably be announced at the same time in the second quarter, they may be announced later, there is some flexibility which we designed in to fit in around the edges if you will over time, but we've clearly got to nail down and announce our primary payload mission. And more specifically not just what it is but how we are doing it, with whom and what we think the real benefits and potential for that will be going forward which we think are quite positive.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
4728125_T,1,"{9,10}","To be honest, I would say that with respect to pricing, I think pretty much everybody in the industry would say these are going to be headwinds, not tailwinds. There is more competition, there is more scrutiny, there is more regulations coming out and just generally more attention being paid on fees. That being said, our strategy on pricing has been to continue to develop out broader and broader services to offer more value at the same cost, and Income+ has helped us to do that. As we predicted, it seems to be true that as we talk to plan sponsors about our increasing service set, including Income+, and as we are now being compared largely in the income space against annuity options that cost 200, 300 basis points, our fees are looking relatively cheap.
  And so we are continuing to broaden the services and move the services towards pricing reference points that are much higher than ours and hold our prices, and so far, we have seen virtually no reduction in our prices. I think our strategy of continuing to add more value at the same price has worked well, and we are going to keep on really pushing on that. So in terms of long-term pricing, we continue to attempt to innovate faster than the pricing pressure might hit us.
  In terms of the costs, I think that's also one that I would say is generally going to be a headwind. When we did these provider contracts early on, there's a question of who gets the revenues that are generated, and what we did is we built in a lot of alignment to say, if we get scale, we will reward our partners for helping us get that scale, because we have a largely fixed-cost business. The breakpoints, and Ray can go into this in a little bit more detail when I'm done, but the breakpoints are all pre-negotiated from deals that were signed many years ago. So they are not a surprise. They're not in response to anything that's been happening in the markets. They're pre-designed to provide incentive to hit scale, and Ray will give a little more detail on that. We expect to have continual gradual increases in data connectivity fees with providers as they hit these breakpoints.
  I would say where we do have a tailwind on costs over the longer-term is that the world is going digital. And when you look at the amount of paper that we print on, and postage that we pay, it's pretty considerable and we are seeing more and more participants going online. We are seeing more and more sponsors want us to communicate with their participants digitally, and we are seeing more of our provider partners also create better systems for communicating with participants online. And so I think where you see a little but of a tailwind in the cost side is we expect to design our enrollment materials and marketing materials to take more advantage of the near-zero marginal cost activities associated with online marketing and start reducing our reliance on the more expensive print costs.
  By the way, in terms of data connectivity, in case it was part of your question, which I am not it sure was, Bob. The Income+ connections don't change the nature of cost associated with provider payments, so this is really just a one-time effort to get the Income+ connection plugged in, and it's taken a little bit longer than expected, not so much because of costs but of constrained IT resources. Ray, I don't know if you want to provide any additional color on the provider AUM-based milestone payments that we are looking at in 2012? Sure, Bob, thanks for the question. As Jeff mentioned, these breakpoints in terms of billions of dollars of AUM at the provider level were negotiated as part of the contract, and we said in earlier quarters that we expected our non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 60% to 65%, and we've been hovering at the high-end of that range. We said that we thought the expected impact of the provider ratchets, as well as increased printing costs for some of the subadvised deals, would push that modestly down, but well within that range. And the hope is that below the gross margin line, we continue to have costs grow substantially more slowly than revenue, which should partially or fully offset the modest decline in gross margins.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

No, we don't expect any further amounts from that. Good morning. Good morning, Tim. My -- were all three major new products fully placed for the entirety of Q4, or can you elaborate on that? Hi Tim. This is Sally. All the major new products weren't fully placed for Q4 and we expect some continued momentum with some of them throughout this year as well because they were introduced later in the quarter. Yes. Which ones were introduced later in the Cobra Tag specifically? That was one of them that and if you've had the certain ones window with some of the retailers we're working with them for this year. So I guess I'm wondering are the new products for 2012 as impressive as 2011? It seems like maybe we didn't have the same level of visibility for awards with some of the most prestigious publications. Or are we kind of -- I know we're always excited about our new products, but quite frankly are we as excited about what's on tap as we were with the kind of recognition we got for Cobra Tag, iRadar and phone links? Are we as excited about 2012 as and as we were for 2011? This is Sally again. Yes, we are very excited about the new products that we introduced at the show and going forward, a lot of it that the products are continuing to field what we've talked previously about the wireless channel and that ecosystem. So a lot of these products bode very well into that category, aside from all of the other products that we introduced at CES just in our core businesses that we've been in.
  So we're very enthused about them. I think we received different awards this year and while it isn't in the award let's say that the at Google stand in Barcelona, it's certainly honor and will help momentum of the Cobra JoyRide. Tim, this is Jim. One thing we can't forget either is that the CES show brought us a lot of exposure that we may not have gotten in the previous show. We're getting now for example FOX News with FOX and Friends film from our booth for all the booths at CES. They chose Cobra's booth to film their morning show from for CES.
  We got a lot of media. Google invited us to their booth in Barcelona and we had a lot of people that came in and we had analysts and stuff like that.
  So from a product standpoint with the number of new products we had and everything we're not displeased whatsoever about what we gained. And we're hoping to even try to top that again next year. Yes. And anecdotally are some of the benefits of all of the visibility the Company has been getting and the kind of the benefits are latent, they're delayed or they build over time as the buzz about Cobra and its products builds? Just for example we had two new major retailers I believe we announced in the previous quarterly conference call that a number of retailer outlets, two [H] retailers that took our products. Is there a build period where they decide to take more products?
  Or maybe you can just speak -- I'm kind of rambling here, but can you speak specifically about the two major new retailers, and when that pipeline was filled and those relationships? And is possible they may expand what they're carrying of our products, the buzz, the buzz type thing here kind of and the reputational visibility that we're talking about and to the point of it? This is Sally again. And certainly there is anecdotally a latent demand and some of it as wanting to get placement with some of these new retailers. You start with one product that performs. We have the opportunity to expand our product assortment there as well as just we know that we're going after a younger consumer as well with some of our products. And getting that into the Cobra brand into their minds as well is certainly building as well, whether it's the brick and mortar channels or the online channels. Brand awareness is certainly key and there's definitely latent demand on that. Tim, I would agree 100% with Sally. There's something else to consider too. If you look at where the Company is going we're beginning to invest in getting our products out there, making them known. You'll see some of that coming through in our increased SG&A expenses.
  We began to do more things to make an [apree] and awareness of this product. And that allows us the things I mentioned, and the things Sally mentioned and so forth allows us to piggyback on those things with our own representation of the products.
  So I don't think any of this stuff is instant. I think it's just like building a brand equity. It's over time, but it continues. It's exponential and it continues to help us get into new channels, get into the new demographics and find additional homes for our products that might now have existed prior to that. That's very helpful. That's very helpful. Thank you. Let me ask two very quick financial questions if it's okay. And then I'll get back in queue.
  One, why was there no write up whatsoever of any deferred tax assets? That's probably for Bob Ben I would think. I'm sorry. When you say write up -- Why was there no write up of any deferred assets? Can if we're profitable now, significantly profitable can't we write up some of our deferred tax assets, put them back on the balance sheet since we might anticipate utilizing them? Do I understand the accounting correctly or not? Well I think that you're referring to NOL levels. Yes. I know what, yes. Yes. The Company does not have any federal NOLs remaining. We've utilized all those. However, we do have some state NOLs. I think I referred to some of those in the press release and in my comments about the State of Illinois. So we other than those state-owned NOLs, which is approximately $500,000, I don't see -- there aren't any federal NOLs that are left for me to utilize at this point. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I didn't realize that. You learn something every day. Well then the other question would be at the board level what about a dividend? Is it possible we're getting to the point where our financial strength and our profitability is such that the board would consider for the purposes of expanding the shareholder base a dividend?
  I filed a 13-D a few weeks ago where I suggested or asked that the board consider a dividend. And I'm wondering if there's anything if they're looking at that or what you could say about that, Jim or Bob? Sure. This is Jim, Tim. We consider dividends every year, every year that we have the profitability and the cash flow. This was admittedly one of our higher years if you add back the hit we had to take on the bankruptcy. We received $5 million in operating profits, but we want to be sure in today's economy, Tim, we're thinking that 2012 is going to be very similar to 2011 in terms of challenges, and economy and stuff like that.
  And we want to be sure that in fact we are repeatable and we are stabilizing. So this year we took a look at and decided that it probably would not be the best use of our money to pay a dividend, although the shareholders I'm sure would have a different opinion of that. And we will review that each year as we do once we have our audited financial results. So prefer to be conservative with it, just following up on that is part of it frankly have to do with the optimism on growth of the Company and maybe looking for internal funding needs for your receivables inventories and sales growth? Yes. I'm not at liberty to share, Tim, all of the discussions we have over it. I can only tell you you would have not been displeased with the discussions as they occurred because we looked at every way, shape or form to see if this made sense. And there's no absolute call on these kind of things. Right. It's always very subjective, but the Company is very confident in its growth possibilities and all of those things. What we don't know, Tim, and we want to temper everything we say because that's what we've been doing about this is there's a lot we don't know about the economy right now. And we believe, as I said, that the economy is going to continue to improve, but at what rate? And whether or not there's going to be other disruption in Europe and so forth we just don't know.
  And at this point in time we want to be sure that we have the capital and we do the right things to continue the growth pattern of the Company and on a sustainable basis. And we just didn't feel like this year was the right year for a dividend although we will consider it again. We have paid dividends in the past. Okay, very good. I'll get back in queue. Thank you. You're welcome. Greetings, folks. Congratulations on a nice year and great quarter. Thank you, Dave. Thanks, Dave. Yes. Question, just kind of a follow-up on what I've heard on geographical expansion, could one of you elaborate a little bit on some more of the key points, particularly on South America because I think that's the first that I've heard in the conference call about identifying South America a little bit? Absolutely. Dave, we have been growing in Europe and our business model over there has worked quite well. We have been doing business here and there in South America. There are a lot of challenges down there in terms of protecting your trademark and other things, but as we looked at the Consumer Electronics Association I noticed in our board meeting there's a projection that Brazil's economy and some economies of others are going to be expected over the next few years to be one of the premium top economies as far as consumption goes in the world.
  Having said that, we don't feel like any longer we can just approach South America and Central America as trading company business, but we need to maybe use the business, the model that's been so successful for us in Europe in terms of maybe going out and identifying distributors and growing that business. So we've identified in 2012 and beyond that is one of our objectives to begin going into those markets and looking at people.
  Now I don't want to -- I want to manage expectations here a minute in the sense that I don't want people to feel like this is going to be a sudden movement that exponentially we're going to go and get exponential sales and everything at a great rate because if you remember Europe it took us awhile to get in there, get the right distributors, change some of those distributors and get that growth pattern and brand equity growing. That is our intention in South America. We feel like we need to be there.
  We know that we will be there. And so in mentioning it the purpose for that was the fact that you should know that this is one of Cobra's initiatives and we plan to replicate the business model of Europe in South America. And we feel like it will be good for us and our shareholders over the next few years. Okay, great. Thanks. Kind of an offshoot to Tim's question on the dividend, I guess I would at some point it would be nice, but again I think the perspective for me is from 2006 to 2009 we lost nearly $5.40 a share those four years.
  And now we've got a couple of nice years building here, $0.21 and $0.47 respectively, but I don't think we're quite ready for that, but it sure is great to see the operating income or the earnings from operations, if I've done my checking right that's the strongest earnings from operations since 2001. Is that correct? I don't know if you've looked at that. I think that's correct. We have that strong, one of the strongest earnings since then. And to that note we want to impress upon all of our shareholders that we are cognizant of how the fact the dividend might bring in other people that aren't currently in the stock and reward the people that are in the stock, but at the same time we wanted to encourage that we are reinvesting in the Company.
  We're not letting idle cash sit around or anything else like that. And we are reinvesting in our growth initiatives of South America. We're reinvesting in our initiatives to get our product name out there, spending more money in terms of marketing efforts and increasing our brand equity.
  And I think all of those things are going to make us, despite what economy we're dealing with, a stronger company because we've dealt in the last couple years with some pretty tough economic headwinds and managed to sustain. And that's because it's been a new product driven and brand equity driven. Okay. Thank you. I've got a question for Bob as well. On EBITDA do you have the -- I think you were at $7.5 million trailing 12 and through nine months you had a 65% increase comp. Do you have a number broken out for the fourth quarter EBITDA number yet? I have an estimate for the year, Dave. For the year it's approximately $8 million. Okay, great. Okay, thanks again and congratulations. I appreciate it. Thank you, Dave. Thanks, Dave. Thank you. I'll go with Timmony. That's fine. Does higher profitability in 2012 mean bottom-line net income, income from operations, adjusted income from operations taking out the bank or CL loss, or what exactly, Bob or Jim, or --? Tim, I'm not sure I understand your question. Could you repeat that please? I believe that we said that the Company expected a higher profitability in 2012, right? That's correct. Does that mean bottom-line net income, income from operations, adjusted income or what's the measure there? What we're talking about when we say we're going to do better we measure most everything on operating income -- Okay. -- because it takes care of -- it takes a lot of consideration. It takes care of a lot of sins if you would and down the P&L. And so we're talking about top-line and operating income growth when we say we're going to do better. Okay, okay, so no adjustment for like the bankruptcy or anything like that, just off the base, the operating income number I'm looking at for the year 2012 and well, I'm sorry, 2011 and then what we'll look for in 2012, correct? Oh no adjustment. You know, Tim, we have in any given year there is some sort of a one-time event or something that occurs. Right. And so we're talking about absolute numbers from this year and for [forting] to next year. And you did I think just say that we do expect certainly a sales increase for 2012, correct? That's correct. And then finally, if I may, hopefully finally, do we expect SG&A to grow, shrink or remain flat as a percent of sales in 2012? SG&A will grow slightly. Most of that, about half of that, Tim, will be relative to our variable selling expenses associated with sales growth. We have programs in all the variable expenses that are tied to it and some of it will be our reinvesting in marketing programs and so forth, as I mentioned to accommodate a better knowledge of our area plus some the expenses we'll incur in South and Central America. But as a percent of sales, Jim, SG&A as a percent of sales in 2012? And we don't get that far down into the line and stuff. I apologize, but -- Okay. -- we -- No. Don't apologize. I just I -- that's fine. I just wanted to clarify. Okay, so no guidance either way on whether that will grow, shrink, remain flat of the percent of sales correct? Well our guidance is pretty specific. And that is that we feel like that the first quarter will be better than the first quarter of the previous year, and I'll define that as top line and operating income and the same for the 12 months ending in 2012. Okay. Just one or two quick others here, were there any product shortages in Q4, or any problem we had supplying anything? No. Actually we did very well this year. We've had some troubles in the past and it's cost us a little bit of air freight and stuff, but this year I'm very pleased with the way we've managed our vendors. And there's been some tough times over in China right now, but we've had a group of vendors. Our products were delivered on time and we had very little issues with either air freighting or losing out to any sales because of lack of inventory.
  And by the way, Tim, you see some of that in our inventory buildup at the end of the year because we anticipated a long Chinese New Year, and an early Chinese New Year and a longer one. And so we built up some of that inventory, our slowly cost safety stock in anticipation of being able to deliver an increased demand in the first quarter. And then finally I guess road shows, what's the nature of that how we'll be talking to the Street if at all, and what's the calendar for that, the telling of the Company's story? Well our calendar is about the same as it was last year. Normally we wait for people to come back from holidays, get past the first quarter and get some stuff in, and second and third quarters normally the quarters we anticipate having some sort of IR events.
  We've committed to do this, fourth quarter again maybe, but a lot of times people are there's too many holidays built into there and it's our busiest time of the year. So you can expect to see some IR activity in the second and third quarter of this year. Congratulations on a very -- is that it? Congratulations on a very solid year. Thank you very much, Tim. Thanks, Tim. Thank you. Thank you, operator. We certainly appreciate your participation today and your continued support of the Company. We're pleased with the results of both our fourth quarter and our year ended December 31, 2011, and we'll continue to strive for even better performance in the quarters and years ahead.
  This together with the gradually improving global economy, our growing brand equity and a strong distribution network here in North America and in Europe, as well as our exciting new products positions us well for success in the year ahead. However, there are still uncertainties with the economy like high unemployment, high commodity prices, some disruption in labor in China and so forth, which serve as reminders that there are still challenges for us and other companies in our industry.
  As a result we will continue to be diligent in containing costs and managing working capital, as well as staying in touch with our customers' needs so we can find quickly the new opportunities. Again, I want to remind you this Company has that develop or die philosophy and continues at a fast pace as we look forward to announcing more innovative new products in the near future.
  As noted in our press release this morning we expect that our results in the first quarter of 2012 and in the first quarter of 2011, although seasonal loss is likely. Additionally, based on our success in 2011 our Company remains well positioned in the year ahead, and therefore we also expect to achieve higher profitability in 2012.
  Again, please do not hesitate to call me if we can be of any assistance. And finally thank you again for your continued support of Cobra Electronics. Operator, this now ends our fourth quarter 2011 conference call.",test,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE
4734913_T,1,"{77,78,80,82}","Yes. The answer is yes, there's always opportunities. We continue as one of the other earlier questions and answers might provide, we're always on the lookout for opportunistic transactions from any source, from the manufacturers, from other leasing companies, from airlines, et cetera. We have simply set forth in our 10-K and our disclosures now what the current status of our new aircraft orders are. There could be situations that come up where we may step into orders that another airline wants to vacate, that it could be a variety of different things. It's really hard to say when and where and how. But I think the overall answer to your question is yes, it is certainly possible for us to increase our orders for 2013. Yes, what's contained on page 34 of our 10-K is our current orders and we would refer to that as our base plan. Then in addition to our base plan we would obviously look at transactions that fit into our portfolio planning, expanding our customer base, geographic diversification, as long as its aircraft types that we feel will be a strong candidate for our long-term operations. As of December 31, that's what we have on firm order. We can't really make specific observations on what airplanes we're going to buy three months from now, six months from now, that we will deliver in 2013. Obviously, we are growing the Company and the probability is that we will add units to that rather than go down. So it is the base case and you should look at that way.

4735755_T,1,{23},"As we look at our pipeline for MND opportunities, assuming that we can be successful in a large majority of cases, that on its own could probably get us back in to a profitable spot. We have other opportunities that are also very exciting. I talked about them in my script, one being we are really focused on what we can do to make the whole mobile hot spot experience a lot easier on the consumer, and how we can reduce costs for the carriers. Then number two, our application control product that I've talked about really helps build a fence to cut down on those folks that are freeloading on a carrier's wireless data service without paying them, and giving them a way to regain a lot of the revenue that was lost.
 Then lastly, based on the release we put out this morning, we see some new plays for expanding our role in the connectivity space with our QuickLink Zero product. This product is a zero install. Everything resides on the USB device. There are no drivers. It is a particularly simple approach to getting users up and on the air, and we see traction there as well.
 Actually, I think when you really look at it, there's probably four different product focuses, all of which can have a strong impact on our revenues. I say that not because I want to diminish the impact of products like visual voicemail or push-to-talk, or some of the other products like device management. They also have opportunities, and we see some of these that will close. I think there's a lot of plays. It's all about execution.
 I can't fix what happened in 2011. The market changed. What we can do though, is leverage on all the investment we made in R&D over the last few years by delivering these new technologies that carriers seem to want to buy, and clearly the MND one is fully validated now with the Sprint contract. We hope to be able to validate the others with contracts, and then, I think the question about how do we get back to profitability becomes a lot easier for all of you out there to gain the same confidence that I might have.",test,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

And now this whole category in United States is a little bit under challenge, yet at the same time pizza is doing well, has been growing last year. But the Hot Pockets, Stouffer's, Lean Cuisine is an impression not as brands, any categories. So for example Lean Cuisine is keeping or increasing shares, although Lean Cuisine had some trouble two or three years ago, it is now back, but the category is down. And that's linked with the reality, the subdued environment of consumers specifically in that category, reflecting in that category.
  Some categories are reflecting more and more or faster towards that downturn than others, and there is this frozen dimension. But as we are priding ourselves to be leading this category, we have to inspire the category. So it's a challenge. We're working on that. It's high on the priorities because it has given us so much joy. We want to feel the same -- repeat the same feeling again. But it is not giving the same joy now because it doesn't help to build the Nestle model, which is growth. And then so we take it up.

4741712_T,1,"{3,4}","Sure. Thanks, Ritu. I'll comment briefly and I'm going to ask Joe to, Joe Kennedy, our-- whose close to many of these to comment. The 408 was a continuation of the patents that when we submitted back in January. And what we did was that particular one, I believe, dealt with the LDL, so it was the MARINE study of the LDL, so that was it. And then the 889 is the standard MARINE patent that we've continued to talk about.
 In terms of what we expect from the patent office, it's always hard to predict. Again we'll hopefully have the knowledge about what the response is formally, quickly. And again, it will show up, as it often does, in the [para] database that everyone has access to as well from the USPTO. But I think in terms of different responses that are out there, the patent office tries to get back to everybody within 90 days. Sometimes they get back within 45 or 60 days like we have seen on the MARINE patent, in other cases as we've seen on the 598, the EPA in a capsule without the [HA] patent, it's taken longer than 90 days. I don't think anybody can read anything into any of those patents and their responses, because different patent agents have different work loads, et cetera.
 In terms of other patents that we should hear about, we did submit a response on the ANCHOR patent that went in recently. And we have stated, I don't think we've stated the exact number, but as I mentioned earlier today, it's part of this new Track 1 process that started with the new fiscal year in terms of prioritized review. There are numerous patents that we put out there that can go from first filing to approval before the end of this year, for example. Again I'm not saying that one or all or none of those would happen, but there were quite a few of those. And we feel very strongly about the 16 disclosed patents that we talked about so far. So that's sort of my high level view on it, Joe K., did you want to say anything about the 408 or the 889 or the duration? Sure, just to clarify a little bit. The 408 application is a continuation, it's one of five continuations that were filed off of the original 889 application. We looked at the 889 application and what we decided to do with that is to narrow the issues for the patent office and to file five separate continuations that would build off the 889, take little pieces from it and put them on five additional individual tracks with the patent office to -- all to aid in a quicker noticeable allowance. So they are somewhat related in that they all were born from the 889 patent. But now that the issues have narrowed in the 889 patent and in the multiple continuations, you'll see different patent ability stories and different office actions that will flow from each of those.",train,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE

4756402_T,1,"{20,21}","Pete can give you more detail, but generally I'll say that our premiums are much more in line to where they should be. So our reinsurance is a huge expense. When we had those mitigation credits back a year or two that really just kind of exploded and took away about 30% of our premium. The rate increases have absolutely helped to get us back to more normal times.
 And the big number -- I've had some people ask about gross written and the growth in gross written. Really the main thing that people should look at is the growth in net written after we cede off that reinsurance expense. So I think you're going to see more normalized ratios on where we are at now versus what we experienced back in 2009 and 2010. Yes, William, looking at the operating expenses over the last year, early in 2011 we unfortunately went through some layoffs that reduced salaries by $1 million. We've also -- and in doing so we outsourced some functions that are done more efficiently and cheaper by third-party vendors. We've cut back in areas where we were spending money, little areas here and there, but it all adds up.
 And then lastly, the biggest piece, our number one expense kind of after reinsurance is the loss -- and the loss adjusting expense on our book. And this kind of goes to what Mike was saying earlier about underwriting. As our underwriting has improved the frequency of the claim reports has dropped and our loss ratios are dropping to a more manageable level.
 And also the denominator is getting bigger because of these rate increases. It's the loss over a larger amount of earned premium. So both the denominator is getting bigger and the numerator is getting smaller and I think that the ratios that we quoted here, barring a storm, are more normalized ratios going forward.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

 In Europe I think demand is okay, not great, flat to modestly down, better in some countries than in others. Fortunately in the countries we participate I think they are the better countries in Europe. Germany and France and the UK is where we tend to focus and not as much in some of the other countries that are more challenged right now.

 The same tariff plans would be used for both domestic transportation of cargoes to the domestic ports and for the cross-border transportation to the ports of their neighboring countries, which means effectively that provided that this provision is implemented since July 1, 2013, same tariff seems to be applied for both domestic transportation of Russian ports and foreign ports. And it means that there will be $15 to $20 difference per metric tonne; $15 to $20 efficiency in railway transportation, which means that catchment; and this is a significant figure in terms of rail transportation costs, which means the catchment area for our terminals should increase.

4760377_T,1,{35},"Actually, no. I think that, with the continuation of the remediation that we talked about with the McNeil consumer business, and the fact that we now have the Crucell business in the full year, we would expect gross margin to not be at the low point now, and actually be under a little pressure for the remainder of the year. And actually, in looking at all your models, I noticed that many of you have that pretty well pegged as a lower gross margin this year, versus last year.

4760565_T,1,{19},"For Japan, Olivia, we were modeling Q2 about where Q1 was or a slight trend improvement over Q1 with about a 3% decline for the year, which means you will see an improvement in the second half as the comps do get a little bit easier. And we are also launching the Body Galvanic Spa in Q4 in Japan, which will be a nice launch, and as I indicated in my remarks should get us flat to slightly up by the end of the year.
 So you know, it's -- I would say it is slow trend improvement in Japan, but we are seeing signs of hope. The negative number you see in North Asia there in the quarterly release of about a 3% down in the executive account is entirely Japan related. And Korea as you know Korea has just been an absolute all-star market for us for 12 years to 13 years.
 And the market is getting to the size where it is difficult to maintain the growth rates we have enjoyed over that period of time. But the market is also going to take breaths -- deep breaths from time to time in between product launches and major opportunity renewal launches and stages.

4762998_T,1,{3},"Thanks, George and I would say you're right. The majority of our growth is heavy oil, but there's significant light oil growth from the synthetic from Horizon. And obviously, our light oil growth in Canada is growing at 15% from both 65,000 barrels a day. So we do have light oil growth, so it's a good balance there. But a lot of it is coming from heavy oil from the thermal projects and from primary heavy oil and at Pelican. So each one of those things would probably have a different cutoff point.
  I would say if you start with thermal heavy oil, depending what your gas price is. If you had gas prices in the CAD5 range -- and obviously we're a lot lower than that today -- but if you had gas prices in the CAD5 range, you would probably look at about a CAD55 to CAD65 range to cut off. Primary heavy oil would probably be even lower than that, in the CAD50 range. And then Pelican Lake, I would say would be close to the same as primary, in that CAD50 range.
  Now obviously with lower gas prices our thermal heavy oil would have a lower cut point. Now differentials obviously play a big part of it, so we're assuming we have in those prices or that normal range of 22% to 24% of WTI. That's where we think long term where we'll end up and we could tell, obviously our primary heavy oil wells are very effective.

When you write off $500,000, EUR500,000, it's a tough comparison. But I think if you go back even before the big write-off -- I'm just trying to help you as much as I can. I think Siemens was very critical of their T&D margins and where they had gone. We worry about ours also, and we've been fighting that with the cost-out and all the other things that we've done.

4781210_T,1,{16},"Sure, thanks, Rich. As it relates to the occupancy and rate mix, we do expect that mix to change fairly meaningfully and totally reverse in Q2 through Q4. It really relates to the seasonality of the business in the first quarter. It's easier to pick up occupancy than rate, and we also had some positive comparisons at properties that had been under renovation in the first quarter last year, so we were recovering occupancy where we were unable to have the same occupancy levels as the markets that we are in.
  As the quarter and the year goes on, we expect ADR to be the predominant portion of our RevPAR growth. We have a lot of properties running at occupancy levels in the upper 80s in New York, into the low to mid 90s. And that's about all there is, in those markets. So the growth is really going to be driven by ADR throughout the bulk of the rest of the year.
  As it relates to bucket, Rich, we saw at the beginning of the year -- we talked about this 60 days ago -- Atlanta has a very good convention year in place. We are seeing a healthy base of business as a result of that and a lot of very good group business that we put on our books the second half of last year for this year. So we have a great group pace. The market, we think, is healthy. Business travel continues to improve. And so we think Buckhead is going to have a good year.

4783587_T,1,"{4,6,7}","Let me start with why Datsun brand? Today, there is segments, particularly in emerging markets, where we don't compete. We have no product offer. And we don't think we can compete with the Nissan brand, because what is required in these markets are ultra-low cost vehicles, with completely different specification; completely different expectation; that if you [bring] the Nissan brand in this field, you end up not having too much consistency for the brand.
 So we decided to introduce a new brand, to be more free to adapt to the requirements of the customer. Obviously, the Datsun brand, addressing this lower part of the market, that we don't address today; we have practically no offer, and this part of the market is quite significant, because in India it's about 50% of the market; in Russia it's about 40% of the market. We think that with the new green program that the Indonesian Government is starting, the ultra-low cost cars are going to represent also 40% of the market, we have no offer there.
 So by allowing us to be very innovative and totally focused on this particular requirement, we think this is the best strategy, not only to grow the Company, but also to differentiate between what the Nissan brand will be accomplishing from one side and what we can accomplish over there.
 It would be fair to say that the brand will be much more frugal, in term -- which means that this brand's going to be managed with lower dealer margin, with lower fixed-marketing expense, with lower everything. Because this is a concept of being able to address ultra-low cost and it would have been extremely difficult to do it with the Nissan brand.
 So I don't think you should see it as additional expenses. I think on the contrary, it is more savings, because we are allowing ourselves to have lower fixed marketing expense, lower margin for dealer, lower price, in order to match the requirement of the these particular customers. Now the first question was the balance between investment? Well, obviously, the -- we need to have a certain amount of cash on our balance sheet. That's obvious. And this amount of cash, there is a minimum absolute amount, but there is also an amount which is due to the circumstances around us.
 The visibility on 2012 is really very low. We don't know what kind of year we're going to have in front of us. We know that this is going to be another year of growth for the industry. But, for example, there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding Europe; there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding Japan; there is some uncertainty in some emerging markets; not about if these markets are going to grow, but what kind of growth we're going to be seeing.
 There is still a financial uneasiness at the level of the planet. That's why we will continue pile up cash during the year 2012. We have the intention to have the positive free cash flow for the year 2012, which means that we were going to be adding to this cash. This is not an objective by itself but just to make sure that in case of a financial, I would say, surprise, we will not find ourselves in a situation where we found ourselves in 2008 or 2009.
 Obviously, there is a limit to this, which hopefully will be set when the environment will be much clearer than what it is today. This being said, obviously, we are increasing the dividend by 25% and this policy of increasing gradually the dividend will continue in a way, hopefully, which will be sustainable.
 And so we're going to continue to have a strong balance sheet, increase the dividend and the mix between the two will depend on what kind of environment we are foreseeing in front of us.

  So our priority is our organic growth and continue to expand and invest in those opportunities where we can grow geographically, as well as some attractive markets, specifically in our core space. As well in continuing to invest in our dewatering and our analytics business, both from an organic prospective, as well through acquisitions. So we see a nice pipeline of candidates that we're looking at.
  We're actively engaged in opportunities for us to quickly move. You've seen us actually have a very nice success with our acquisitions over the last two years, and so that's where we'll be putting our first priority in terms of investing organically and acquisitively. Jim, I guess I'd also ask, and I talked about it a little bit on the margins. We had a ten point drag on the incrementals becauseof that organic investment we're making back into the business. So, for example, the expansion we made into Russia is a prime example of that, where we'll continue to invest in the sales channel of the business, as well as continue to invest in the organic growth initiatives like we've done in the past with ESV and the Flygt Experior.
  So we see, as we indicated, investment being about a 50 basis point drag relative to operating margins, but that's where we've really focused on driving gross margin improvement to be able to fund continuing to invest in the business. And, Jim, just one other thing in terms of new projects. We've been launching quite a few new projects over the last couple of years, but we're also thinking about how we can use smart information, so we've gotten into smart apps and making it much easier for our customer base to work with our sales teams out in the field, configuring their applications and their solutions, and that's another area where we've been investing as well.

And I think, Lennox, the other thing I would say is, one of the key variables that I look at if I have to say, how can we unify our focus as a business that unites us around quality and speed? Is really looking at report turnaround time. So where we get a request from a physician to a patient to go and pop into one of our clinics, either an imaging or a lab clinic.
 If we can focus our organization and all of our efforts around speeding that cycle time up, that will become a continual competitive advantage. We already have scale advantages in a number of disciplines today. By doing that, and focusing that, that also shows our teams inside that they can aggressively and impactfully help healthcare professionals make decisions in a timely manner -- in a quality manner.

We've always been there, but especially now.
 I think the way we can be successful, in addition to what Tom explained in terms of looking for new opportunities, is by doing more volume in our current operations, and that's where the trend is coming from. From the Don Drummond report that was very clear in the Ontario budget to do more work in the community-based environment, where you can deliver the same quality of service, increasing access to patients.

If you remove that, our margins are flat to last year and so as we sit here now, you know, still relatively early in the year, we look at Q1 and apart from the A-B fees we do see that several -- a number of positive things went our way, both shipment volumes and production volumes that leveraged our P&L.

Not really. Germany is probably the major area in those regions. We have seen some effect on our tourism exhibitions. Those that are funded by central government are obviously the most sensitive because of the austerity measures.
 So you'll have noticed that our tourism event was a little bit flat this year. Obviously, Greece are big participants there, as are Spain and Italy, and extracting money from the government or national tourist offices in those countries was a bit harder.
 For those businesses which rely on exports for their growth you always hope that whatever's happening in the domestic economy they still want to participate in markets that are growing. And that's been our experience in the past, that they've been -- if we looked at our experience through the 2008 recession the internationals dropped off a little bit, but the biggest effect was actually in Russia, where the locals went down and came back. So big international companies who are, I suppose, professional exporters fairly consistent and applied in building their positions in export markets.
 In Asia, you asked how we were going to grow, whether it could be done organically or by acquisition. I think a mix of both is the realistic answer. Where there are very developed markets -- and China might be an example. I don't think I would be trying to launch events in China. I would look to acquire an established event there.
 In other markets which are less developed like, perhaps, Malaysia or Vietnam, there's probably plenty of opportunity to launch our own events and to grab our own position.
 In either event our first step is really to establish a strong local office; that's how we do business. So we need to either make a small acquisition or build out from our outbound office. We need some people there who know the venues and know the business and that's the first step either way. So I think a mix of both, depending on circumstances.
 In terms of exhibiting a note of caution, we simply know that in our business, if there were to be -- we looked at our experience over, I suppose, 2008/2009 and we know what happened both in our local markets, when there was a collapse in the oil price, and what happened in the international markets. So not so much caution in acquisitions, just that we're going to trade with enough cash in hand or bank facility in hand all the time to be able to accommodate a shortfall of our business in the event that there was to be a big problem prompted by a problem in the eurozone.
 So it's just mindful really. We're not going to end up breaching any kind of borrowing limits, or covenants or anything, not that we need to at the moment.

So since 2008 we've paid down more than $100 million in debt, and that gives us good comfortable breathing space with a really, as you mentioned, net debt free balance sheet with plenty of borrowing capacity if we need it. And we've continued to invest in new businesses; we continue to invest in our technology; and we've continued to make strategic investments in bolt-on acquisitions and ideas that can accelerate some of our core capabilities today and of course we made a few investments internationally now, which are proving to be quite good as well.
 So you see how we use our cash -- pay down debt, invest in the future, invest in your good and your growing businesses. But we've had the flexibility on top of that with the performance that we demonstrated in the last couple of years, to generate excess free cash flow over our needs; and there we've -- now that we're getting to the point where we have little debt, we'll pay down. We're scheduled to pay down another $16 million in debt this year -- that's a minimum we'll pay down -- gives us some flexibility to make other decisions there.

4854469_T,1,"{3,4,5,6,8}","Alexia, let me start with second quarter because frankly I can give you a much better view of that in the rear view mirror than I can in advance of the third quarter on core. Our core for the second quarter finished up about 5% but frankly we had some political displacement in June in some of our key political markets where the political funnel began in mid-May. So if you extrapolate the core that we displaced in June we probably were up closer to 6.5 and 7 if we had not had that political in core in the second quarter. Where third quarter will end is very difficult to say for us because Olympics so much affects our inventory and especially political. But it is pacing very good right now. That pace, and that's industry-wide, as core advertisers place their business early in advance of political demand, so it's very difficult to say where it will finish. But the fundamentals appear to be strong, specifically auto remains very strong and frankly is tracking along with the good sales data that we're all seeing on car sales. I would just add to that that as you know from prior years, Alexia, as we get towards September when the political is really ramping up, that displacement factor becomes a much more important issue. And then when you think about the markets we have like Cleveland, Tampa, St. Louis, Denver, which are going to be very heavy from a swing state perspective, that's going to also result in the displacement. So the core will be I think as you look into September artificially lower because of that significant displacement factor that's very focused on a finite set of markets. August will be artificially higher because of the Olympics. So it's very difficult to give you a good industry number only than to say our number will be good especially by Olympics. Alexia, on the other parts of our business, we feel very good about the progress on the Publishing side that we're making on circulation. And you saw that US Community Publishing had circulation revenue growth a little over 1%. We would fully expect that that number would be reasonably higher in the third quarter as the launches continue to take hold and we launch more sites. So that will be a very nice story for Publishing in the third quarter. I hesitate to really comment on advertising because the level of volatility, and as Dave said, the placement of advertising very late makes it really difficult to hone in on trends. You saw the volatility that we just came through in the second quarter. But a lot will obviously depend on consumers and marketers and how they feel.
 Olympics will be good, good for USA Today and our sports group there. We're starting out the quarter as we would have expected, so a lot will be set over these next few months. And obviously this quarter, September is a very important month with the back-to-school trends that we'll see. So it's just a little early. We'll make sure that we keep everybody updated as the quarter unfolds.
 And in Newsquest of course is doing a terrific job and outperforming their regional press competition on the top line side and certainly on the bottom line side as well. And then on the Digital segment part, CareerBuilder continues to post very good numbers, despite what is a very high unemployment rate and a tepid view of the economy. But I think that a lot of the product innovation that they have done at CareerBuilder has resulted in them being able to post very strong numbers even in light of a difficult job environment. And then obviously for them on the international front, they've done some good acquisitions and that part of the business is a strong positive for them. So we feel good about where we are headed this coming quarter, feel good about the progress we're making on a lot of fronts, the economy, as it will for a lot of industries, will ultimately determine how things go but broadcast obviously is going to be a terrific home run for us in the third quarter.

As I said, the French market accounts for 9% of the total revenue of Teleperformance.
 (inaudible - microphone inaccessible) -- France during the whole evening, now I'm going to continue in English.
 I can say that, Madame, I am very impressed by your ability to calculate the results of France and the deviation versus what we were expecting. I think that you are right.
 Now having said that, what is the explanation? The explanation is very simple. Significantly less volume than what was expected. Is it going to continue? Of course, yes, because the telecom market in France is not good.
 Do we have a strategy to get out from this trap? Yes. What is this strategy? I'm certainly not going to disclose it now because I'm not here to please my competitors or all the people who want that since Teleperformance.
 Then, again, France is a geography that is not today a contributor to the group. We are focused on changing that in a very responsible way, meaning without education and without and trying to avoid social dramas. Just answer you about working capital, you mentioned that we had agreed to a working capital of EUR25 million. You should take into account the increase of the sales, which is EUR60 million and take out 20% which is roughly the [66, 67] based payment. That means that we have still an increase of EUR13 million, which is not due to the business to increase the business. It is mostly due to our sales. Three or four specific reasons, either in France, either abroad in Mexico linked to the tax and the Social Security issue.
 I do believe that for 2000 -- for the whole year, we will have an increase limited to roughly the increase of sales. There is no reason that by the end of the year it will not be different from that. So it is partially due to the fact social charges are paid in some countries in advance, and we do benefit from that for other reasons. But that at the end of the year, we will be on track again. (interpreted) Question. There seemed to be a big change in CapEx with a 3.7 multiple something going down. Is this something that is sustainable in the medium term?
 Second question, you have EUR4 million in shareholdings in the second half linked to increased taxation decided by the French government. Is that why you provisioned for it, or is it that part of the profit sharing plan? About your last question, the first one regarding the CapEx during the first half, I would say that I think that what is sustainable is a 4% CapEx. During the second half -- during the first half, we were at 3.7%. Sometimes we are at 4.5%. It is very difficult to manage, and I'm going to explain to you why.
 We might have in one geography an excess of capacity, but we might sign at the same time a new contract in a geography where all our capacities are full and we need to make CapEx.
 So there is a kind of recurring rule around the CapEx that tends to be around 4%. There are multiple factors that impact the CapEx. One is the fact that -- one positive is the fact that we try to be always more efficient in our purchasing process, and the technology tends also to be less expensive nominally speaking.
 But at the same time, we tend to have more and more business in offshore location, and the cost of the CapEx versus the revenue tends to be higher.
 So I think that that 3.7% -- I wish we can stay at the 3.7%, I'm not sure. But I would say that to consider a CapEx in the range, in the 4% range is something that we are fighting for. When I say fighting for, it is not so easy because we -- at the same time, we have the business development, and with the business development usually comes the CapEx. So it is always an interesting trade-off. Clearly. Just a word about your question about participation, it is not exactly participation. It is the fact that when you grant a performance share, you are obliged to take a countercharge in your accounts if the shares are delivered.
 We believe today that the two conditions could be met by the end of this year. So we are obliged to put the provision to cover these costs, which is, as I mentioned, only an accounting cost and not a cash costs. So we are going to recognize a charge in the second part of the year of EUR4 million if we achieve such performance condition, if the conditions are met. I just would like to notice that Olivier now will let in the responsibility for what he said. Just say that he believes that the conditions for the performance share plans could be reached, and the condition for the performance share plans are at the very high of our guidance. Yes, I just mentioned in my speech before that if the charge is confirmed, which is not yet configured. Thank you for the precision. (interpreted) Good evening. Two questions. Could we have operating margin per geographic zone on a like-for-like basis as regards foreign exchange?
 Second question, in May you spoke about profitability in Brazil. What impact on earnings? And here for the first one because the second one -- you know, there is something that our business is managing an army of 120,000 people. When we speak about Brazil, we speak about seven or eight centers, and we speak about 17,000 people.
 When we say that we have a focus between the time we say that we have a focus, we implement the focus and the time you have a transformation, it takes more than a few months.
 I can tell you that in Brazil it is also a question of trade-off. Because the faster we grow, the less we have profitability because we have all the costs of implementing the contracts.
 So to have the fastest possible effects -- positive effects on the possibility on Brazil, we need to slow down the growth. And today I have to say that when I make an analysis on the fundamentals of our group, top line, bottom line, I tend to think that we are pretty well-balanced. We do not push for a crazy growth in Brazil, but we don't want neither to slow down our current success, which are the profit of tomorrow.
 So you are going to see improvement in Brazil. There is already some improvement. But I can tell you that the improvement in the LATAM region that you saw this year come mostly from the work that we have done in Spain and because Spain is not anymore a source of losses for us. Totally agreed on, which I will answer your question about operating margin by zone, excluding foreign currency. There is no impact in Europe or very minimal impact.
 Most of the 50 basis points I just mentioned for the group is coming from this LATAM region, not all, but a significant part, more than half, because we have been able to hedge properly some currency. I'm speaking to the Mexican pesos to the Colombian pesos and the other.
 But we have also a meaningful small impact in Europe zone with the Philippine pesos and the Australian dollar, too. So that is -- I'm not going to give you in details the figure. I may give you by the end of the year when we will be totally finished, but I just wanted to mention that the growth -- the 110 basis points we get for the whole year is not coming at all for their current hedging. Less than half of it is coming from the hedging and mostly is due to it coming from the Ibero-LATAM region. That is where we are. (interpreted) Another question. On growth in English-speaking countries in the first quarter, minus 5.5% in the second quarter below 2%, aside from the major US contracts, what level would we have reached with the US contracts? I cannot give you the figures, but we are positive. Just 1.5%, in fact. (interpreted) So things have been improving over the quarters, but what about trends for the entire year? For the USA is that we have a strong company. We are expecting a strong end of year. Last year was already extremely strong, so I don't know how much stronger we are going to be. It is outside of my capacity to say how stronger we are going to be because it's going to come from the actual volumes, of course, from the consumers, and this I don't have any magic stick to say what it is going to be. But we do not foresee for the US any change of the trend, which means that the US should be outside of the contract positive in growth and in any case are going to improve the profitability. (interpreted) Thank you so much. (interpreted) A question from Cheuvreux. I would like to come back to a question raised by Patrick, the difference between current EBITA and operating results. We had the translation, but it was not quite clear. Can you tell us the amount to be expected for 2012?
 I have another question on profitability in Continental Europe about the same losses, about EUR4 million. And yet when I look at your reporting, we are progressing on more or less flat. So there are countries where the situation has deteriorated. I'm thinking of Italy, for example. The USA, things are better in Germany, so that means that in Continental Europe, there are losses, but that is not due to -- what are the things that could offset the disparities we have seen in some countries? (interpreted) I will answer in French on operational issues to make sure that everyone understands clearly.
 For nonrecurring items, in the first quarter there are two things. We have the amortization of intangibles, EUR4.4 million as before, and probably EUR8 million for the entire year as the year before. So nothing new under the sun.
 Secondly, the accounting impact of performance with an impact of EUR6 million in the first half and to catching up on the previous year because there is a 50% chance that the performance levels would be attained. So EUR6 million to which you would have to add a performance is attained, EUR4 million for the second half.
 So if you take the assumption that these performance levels are reached, we will have EUR10 million for the performance ambitions, a charge that is totally non-cash, with no impact on shareholders because the shares were already acquired under favorable circumstances last year. Plus, EUR8 million for intangibles, also non-cash, compliant with last year figures, to which you could add -- I spoke about what we could say about other countries, Italy for example, which is a big difference, and I hope I'm clarifying the issue here.
 There was another question, I believe.
 A question regarding Continental Europe. We should go back more in details, but there are two things. There is a little country where we had a big surprise. It is Austria. It is not big. It is not something that impacts terribly, but it exists.
 There is also a weak performance of our market research company. In those days, market research are not extraordinarily powerful. There is -- and I think that there is still good, but there is some -- it is at a good level, but I think there has been a little stabilization/decrease in percentage of the Nordic because the increases are significantly in the results compared to the (multiple speakers) It is proportional -- (multiple speakers) -- has reduced. But to me, the real effect on Europe, and when we say Europe, improvement in every country, we took the geographic Europe. Because, as you can see, there is the United Kingdom, there is Spain and there is Portugal. And Spain and Portugal is part of the improvement that you see in LATAM. United Kingdom is also part of the improvement that you see in EWAP.
 And so then the main, main event for the group in Europe was what was mentioned by somebody before, which is the fact that we were expecting -- we were not expecting the turmoil in the telecom business in France when we established our forecast 2012. And you have to notice that there is improvement in some countries. The level of improvement is significant, but the size could a bit more important in the second part of the year.
 I am speaking to Germany. I am speaking to other countries like Eastern Europe or Turkey or Greece where the impact of the change would be significantly more important in the second part of the year than in the first part. (spoken in French). More in detail later on. I mean because you are speaking about 1.1% versus what -- you are speaking about reasons that are exactly at the same percentage of level. And you say as France has not improved but some others have improved, I should have some improvement. And what we tell you is that this improvement will be pretty small if it exists, and it has been counterbalanced via some negative news that we had in countries that are not necessarily an issue. And we are not going to go through the details of every single of the 49 countries; otherwise, we are going to speak until tomorrow night. There is no more questions? So we -- (interpreted) I would like to better understand a little better what the French call centers will be like? What will be the situation of the French call centers, particularly in view of the French economy? I'm talking about relocating call centers into France, which is in line with their political claims. The declaration of the French politicians. That is it. (interpreted) But you participate in these political discussions, don't you? Sometimes I understand why this country that I love has some problems because it seems like the French still continue to considerate that France is the center of the world. Are there any other questions? If not, okay, we will then close this meeting. If you have any additional questions later on -- I will answer -- we will answer later on the calls. (spoken in French).

That will come through partners but many of those partners, frankly, will be new partners than traditional VARs or current distributors. So I think they'll be a mixed market, they'll be the traditional markets provided by the traditional channel partners, but clearly as we move into software and video as a service, some of those will be the telcos, of course, some of those will be the ITSPs, and frankly, some of those will be enterprise software channels like Microsoft Lync channels that will be new to our channel portfolios, so it is -- it has to be holistic.

And many of these republican states, as you noted, aren't highly enthused about implementing the Affordable Care Act. A few of them have actually been defiant about this, saying they won't put an exchange in place.
 If they don't, it's very clear in the Affordable Care Act the federal government will come into the state and operate an exchange.
 So, at this point, you have to wonder how much of this is just politicking and how much is real. It's rather hard to believe that a state that doesn't like the Affordable Care Act and what the federal government has done would want the federal government to come in to have a hand in the marketplace there.
 So, we think that, assuming that this law exists in 2014, that most of the states are going to have exchanges up. And, yes. Some of those that aren't, again, real enthused about this will probably put an exchange up that meets the minimum of the federal government ACA requirements.

 So as far as their tools, I'd say that most of our cloud service providers are using some combination of open source and home grown tools and leveraging a lot of our CloudStack APIs that are very Amazon, AWS-like.

It has become I think talked about more and more over time, but forus we are talking about this years ago. So I think there is a just broad acknowledgment with the semiconductor industry through executives talking about the fact that their business models may be under pressure because of the rising costs. Their R&D is being pressured to increase at a time where they are not seeing commensurate returns, and it is deteriorating potentially their business models moving forward.
 We see this as continuing to fuel our growth, because wewe can make a generic product, sell it to lots of customers across lots of markets, and aggregating that volume, be able to justify the R&D. And again because they are under pressure and may not develop solutions, we can move in and take the existing space, which allows us to grow at a faster rate and than our end customers and allows us to grow to a faster rate than the semiconductor industry.
 And I think if you look at the data as the last four years as an example, we grew 15% compound annual. The ASIC industry grew less than 1% compound annual. So the ASIC industry under-grew its customer base and under-grew semiconductors, and I think that's evidence.

 The biggest trouble is, when we look at this, the general cost of shutting in for a short period. You really have to do it for an extended period to make it worthwhile.

4877767_T,1,{17},"Well, interesting question. Let me try to address that and -- but to answer -- but to jump straight on, yes, we have a fairly broad customer base in wireless. We're pretty much doing business now with every smartphone manufacturer. Not every phone manufacturer, but every smartphone manufacturer.
 And that includes, by the way, and on the obviously top line, the largest tier 1 manufacturers, including people like Samsung, you correctly pointed out. And we do a very good amount of business with Samsung, and they are very valued and a very significant customer. But we also sell to Tier 3 white box phone manufacturers in China on a case-by-case basis, depending on the programs and win, and the specific technology they're using.
 So we have pretty broad base, but you're right in that respect. It's a very interesting tiered market now; very, very much a question of picking winners and losers, so to speak, in terms of OEMs.
 We try to cover the full range with the products we have and the technology we have. And some customers really appreciate and are willing to obviously subscribe to our business model of very high performance RF components, being particularly our FBAR components. And some of them uses, I guess, front-end modules with pull-along power amplifiers, our power amplifiers help us increase volume.
 Overall, we -- but to address your question on the pattern of behavior, you know focusing is always hard, but let me try to do that, have draw some reference point by looking back to last year, the last 12 months. And typically, prior to the last year, what happens is in our fiscal Q3 is when we see a strong seasonal uptick in the wireless business. Typical seasonality. It's end of the year, the pay that was back-to-school and Christmas. So, strong typical seasonality up.
 And a continued strong seasonality in Q4. And by that I usually mean 10% perhaps sequentially, maybe then mid- to high-single digits in Q4. Then Q1 will show a drop -- the next Q1 following Q4 will show a sharp drop, and could be mid- to high single -- to even 10% drop. And Q2 -- from Q2 will be kind of flat from Q1, and the cycle repeats itself.
 And that used to be the case, say, two years ago, three years ago. Comes last year, we see a significant change in the pattern, in this whole pattern. And part of it is related to what you're pointing out -- the way the market has segmented itself among OEMs, and based on how those OEMS launch new products and the timing which -- in launches.
 And what we've seen last year was, as we see now is, Q4 -- I mean, there was some small -- some seasonality in Q3. Q4 was a very strong uptick for us. In last Q4, not this Q4, in last Q4. Q1 remains at Q4's level. And Q2 was pretty close to what Q1 was -- flat at that high level. And then Q3 showed a sharp drop off because of a product transition at a major customer. And Q4, as we see now, bounced right back up.
 So if I use this, say, new trend, I would say following this new trend -- I'm not giving you a forecast; I'm just saying strictly following that new trend, Q1 coming up might be flat from Q4's level in wireless.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

 The DoD is and will always be incredibly important to us. There's no doubt about that. That will always be a very, very significant piece of our business. That is the core competency and that's where the engineering talent that we have comes from. So that's not going to change.

We actually think that those analyses are very tough to do because there is an interaction between the high-frequency side, for example, and the other side. So for example, we actually write checks to most of the high-frequency traders because of the rebate model. So we actually lose money on the transaction side with those guys. But then we have market data feeds and co-lo and other things like that. That are not different than almost any other big broker participants, because they also use co-lo and direct feeds.

Yes. We think the momentum in nursing is continuing at about the same pace, but the growth really is starting up in the allied side.

4918484_T,1,{34},"Well let me kick off on that. I mean, obviously look at the margin overall and the margin overall has come down with regard to the customer related margin. So Phil's chart which separates out treasury and markets you can see the margin has come down, in fact, in both halves. But I think we've been quite disciplined in offsetting the additional cost of raising retail deposits because that's where the biggest factor of competitive intensity has been, has been raising retail deposits. So we've been able to offset that quite effectively in the re-pricing that we've done on the lending side.
 In the latter part of this year we've also done more in the way of term funding. So we didn't do much in the early part of the year, as you know but in the latter part of the year we've done more there and we've also, in the latter part of the year, repaid some of the short term debt which as we discussed earlier is the most cheapest form of funding that we have. So that will give us some margin headwind into this coming year and from an exit margin point of view, if we look at end of September, it's clearer lower than the printed margin here for the second half on our customer related margin.
 But we've immunised that to some extent already of course, with the October repricing on mortgages that's already done.

And then if you factor in that we're going to be buying back our shares, let's say, 4 million shares at -- we're going to buy these shares at CAD17 approximately.
 If the price is CAD19, I mean we're not going to buy any. But if the price stays under the CAD19 mark, we're going to buy that. So let's say, put 4 million shares at CAD17, then you put the dividend at CAD15 million. And then you put our CapEx, that's going to be probably be closer to CAD50 million than CAD60 million, net CapEx, okay.

So I think with the exceptions of items like the impairment, we are tracking very well along what our expectations were.
 To be clear, we're very happy with the way we've performed year-to-date.

We continue to see and expect significant leasing opportunities as we bring those sites in and integrate them and market them and are able to provide the solutions -based approach both on services and the site leasing that those sites represent. As you know, it's a very significant increase in our footprint. It's about a 33% increase in our footprint with a very high concentration in the top 100 markets.

So I don't think there's any change in terms of how we look at investments in allocating that capital, and we don't have any preconceived plan as to what the allocation among those will be. We will look at investment as they come up and allocate them to maximize long-term cash flow per share. One item I will note for you, to some degree we may use a relatively small portion of that cash flow to reduce the revolver borrowings. As you know, we are a little bit ahead of our targeted level of leverage range of four to six times.

4923194_T,1,{63},"I think, Diviya, the best way to look at it is that, first thing is that they are growing; absolute number, they are growing. And second thing is that I don't have any client-specific problems with any client. Any of these clients, we don't have any specific problems where we are compensating for huge drop of somebody with somebody else. There is no such thing.
 Then the next thing to look at is, we have a significant number of BFS clients. And you have seen that in the last several quarters the BFS growth has been muted and has been consistently lower than the Company average. So when you have a large number of clients in the BFS segment and you should expect, and also telco clients have been growing slow when you took up the last four, six quarters. And growth has been coming in those clients, growth has been happening in those verticals, but they have been below the Company average.
 So when you look at the LTM perspective, that will happen. And I don't think that that's a cause of worry and also as we grow larger, we should be prepared that all clients in the 10 bracket will not grow on the Company average. Some will grow slower, some will grow faster. But we really look at agility, that's why we have the full services play. And we continue to engage, we continue to try and find and increase our share and increase our proximity and relationships with all these clients.
 So I'm, first of all, not concerned about the growth in the top 10 clients. And I would also say that I cannot uniformly say whether all of them will grow -- all of them will not grow on the Company average. Given our quarter, at least half of them will grow above the Company average and half of them will be either on or below the Company average, which is okay for us.
 But there is also big clients in the next 10, or in the next 20, or in the next 30, which will grow very significantly, double the Company average sometimes, and we need to be able to be very sharp in what we do with clients and be relevant all the time and there is no easy solution. The only thing I can say is every client we got to be relevant. How can we be more relevant? How can we understand what their pain points? How can we understand how they are investing in a relation? What is it that they are doing to reinvent themselves? And that's the question we ask.

But the thing is that I'm still working on the accent, but I see myself as an adopted Australian citizen so I don't know that I can answer that French question.
 Life in London is great. It's one of the great cities in the world because it's a very diverse city and it's a great city, and everybody here has been extremely welcoming. So it's very good. But, again, I don't see myself as a French, or anything else for that matter.

 Let me just say a few words about your questions regarding the emerging markets. I think that, for sure, China is big. And it is -- often when we talk about the emerging markets, really, China has an enormous impact for those markets, for any company. But I don't think we can say we are unbalanced. We have a strong presence in China. We have a strong presence in many other countries.
 In our portfolio, I think the important point is that our portfolio, quite frankly, is the ideal portfolio for those countries. Because if you really think about those markets, in many ways they are where Europe was 20/25 years ago, and many of the unmet needs are in the area of infection; cardiovascular medicine; hypertension; diabetes; DP disorders, etc., etc.
 Respiratory medicine, respiratory disorders are growing in importance, and that's exactly the portfolio of products that AstraZeneca has, and I think there is enormous potential there.
 The challenge for us is, in some parts of China, for instance, like in some countries in those emerging market regions, really to ensure that patients can access our products, because sometimes they are a bit too expensive. Even a product like Crestor is sometimes too expensive for some parts of China.
 So the challenge for us is really to look at how do we get access, and how do we find strategies that will enable access. And, in fact, that's one of the work streams that I have launched, looking at this; how do we leverage our full pipeline. Quite frankly, this will be my first priority before we explore any other options, looking at additional products, because I really believe we have the best portfolio for those markets. Great.

I think that in our outlook, looking to 2013, the odds are pretty good that it returns to a slow -- it goes back to the slow rise that we were seeing. It's been a little bit of a trend in the overall US economy, stronger first half, weaker second half, for the last year or two. Once everything settles down and I think, in particular, if there's resolution on the fiscal cliff and the whole taxing and deficit issues that Congress has to deal with, then I think things will settle down and we can be back in that slow 3% to 5% moderate growth recovery range into 2013.
 The demographics are still driving the number of critical care beds up in the US. The hospitals are just trying to figure out how they make money off of the patient under the shifting insurance schemes and shifting environment that's out there. But, fundamentally, they have patients they need to take care of and they will need to have equipment. Surgeries will still happen. People who get sick will need to be taken care of so those fundamentals are still there. And I think we'll see that return.
 And, clearly, I don't think in any scenario are we, at this point, looking like there would be a dramatic deviation, either dramatically up -- maybe a market that was up in double-digits or a market that's down in double-digits. Under any election scenario I think maybe if we do a worst case is that there's a complete stalemate in government and a failure to resolve the fiscal cliff which is a worst case scenario that I don't think any market participant is really forecasting. Everybody believes this is really going to be resolved.
 And then maybe we've got a more dramatic down that will affect everyone probably healthcare less than many other markets. So the future's hard to predict and we're not in the -- we don't have a roundtable of economic forecasters here to do this but just at our look at it and talking to hospital CEOs and purchasing managers of large organizations, they see this cautiousness now and probably next year being a slight increase over what they did this year is the way they're looking at it, right now.

 In terms of banking it was credit demand and credit demand was growing at 15%, 16%. It's now 4%, 5% and it is likely to remain that way for some time.

Utility, we think we had a really nice quarter. We'll see where the other competitive data points come out relative to our growth, but that was a really nice quarter, we think, given the backdrop.

 We did win another new major IOU alliance agreement in the third quarter, and it's integrated supply for both power gen and delivery, so we're very excited about that, and that will start to really kick in, in the fourth quarter. Those take four to six quarters to reach full implementation rate.

 One thing we should need to keep in mind is, if you recall, we had a very strong quarter, the last quarter of fiscal year 2012, right. We had a remarkably strong June. The strongest we have ever had to my recollection in terms of activity. So, by ending the year so strongly, we were anticipating that some of the first quarter activity, okay, could be a little weaker, just because we had such a terrific fourth quarter and June. The strength of the products and the momentum of the products particularly of less than $5 million, alright, continues to be very real and we discussed that at length in our fourth quarter call.
 There is no question we believe that the higher end of the range will require some larger transactions. We are in more active dialogues on larger transactions in our history, and we have been very fortunate and pleased to identify someone with Steve Racioppo's background to join us, who comes from Accenture, with extensive experience in those type of transactions and managing that C-Suite process for literally thousands of professionals at Accenture.
 So, we continue to believe that we have the right products, growing product breadth, very strong product breadth, and are well-positioned and we are, as you can see by the hiring of Steve and other activities, putting more resource behind successfully executing on this opportunity.

Yes. Rich, what I would add on to that one piece, because I think this is very important to how we've done our investments both internally in the acquisitions, is that if you think that about $110 million to $115 million, we should be definitely thinking that was a $90 million to $110 million of deals under $5 million.
 And that is very important to us because the acquisitions by the way, you go back a couple of years they were only providing just around $10 million per year and they currently last year delivered just under $30 million and of course, we are expecting to see north of somewhere around $40 million.

But it's also a very -- the on net portion, obviously, is a very high margin service. So the underlying mix doesn't really change with these products, because it helps us to sell more of the underlying. But then, like Larissa said, you layer on the Dynamic Capacity and that's all margin. And so I don't see the products changing being a cause of the change in the mix. If we add a bunch of salespeople and nobody produces, but what happens with that is that it smoothes out because then they start to produce, and so that eventually you're selling a lot more high margin revenue that you're bringing in and they're focusing on bigger customers, and the bigger customers primarily buy on net services from us. They buy a lot of on net services from us, and so-- And they are very sticky. The bigger the customer, the more differentiated products, those are the stickiest. And those are the ones, quite honestly, when we talked about repricing earlier, the more differentiated the product offering, the less of that you have over time, too. So it's, I think, all very complimentary to our strategy. But to expand the margins, as we've said over and over again, it's really to build in further density within our existing markets. And so gradually, that is what we would expect to help us expand the margins over time. And that's -- by adding more salespeople, that's what we're doing is moving exactly moving the dial on that strategy, and that's increasing the penetration in those markets, because that's what drives our margin growth, long term.

 However, on the other hand, given that the generics and similars, they grow at a faster pace than the rest of the (inaudible), that still represents a slight dilution of the average gross margin. But overall, I think the third quarter represents a good proxy of our margin.
 On the Consumer division, you are right. We still have some opportunities of improvement of margin, especially on the segments more related to diapers and oral care.

4964788_T,1,{61},"I think, David, I think that is -- we've gone through quite a bit of analysis and our groups are going through that process right now looking at 2014. I think the general feeling is it's going to be moderate. I think you used the word moderate and that's the one I was thinking of as kind of referring to what is probably going to come out of all of these planning meetings that we are having throughout the Company.
 I think we certainly see on the Aerospace side a positive story going forward. I think that's going to stand out as probably more positive than the Industrial side, but I think the Industrial will be positive. But it's going to be at lower levels; it's just going to be a more moderate growth story going forward than we've seen in past years. We would like to see this back to where it used to be, but I guess we're going to have to wait to see that happen.
 Europe is really the wildcard. As you heard from Jon and Pam, obviously we are going to have to do some restructuring there. We are going through a restructuring now with a lot of the acquisitions.
 Probably a higher percentage of the acquisitions came from Europe or are in Europe, so we have more work to do there. Maybe the larger dollar size acquisitions are there. We are consolidating sales companies and so forth, so irrespective of whether it grows or not, I think our performance will improve in that region. So we are really not going to project, I don't think, unless some groups come back with some surprise, a high growth in Europe for sure.
 I think when you look at Asia I think we are going to say that we are going to have moderate growth in Asia. Of course, the entire country of China has dropped from 12% down to 7% and we are just getting adjusted to 7% or 8% growth.
 That's going to be probably more normal going forward. I don't think that that's going to change; still a pretty nice level of growth relative to other regions around the world.
 I don't think we are going to project a big increase in Latin America. I think it will be positive, but it will be a small percentages in Latin America. And North America, I think we will see a modest increase as well.
 That's kind of generalizing. I am not giving you any numbers, hard numbers, because I don't have them myself. But just in listening to the groups and understanding where we are in the planning process so far, I think that's kind of how I would characterize what is going to happen in 2014. It will be positive; it will be moderate; some segments will be stronger than others, some regions stronger than others.
 It will be kind of a little bit of a mixed bag, but overall I think from a profitability standpoint I think we are taking the appropriate actions. As you saw here, generating 14% operating margins in this environment is something this Company has never done before at this point in the cycle. I mean we have really done something very, very spectacular in this Company generating those kind of margins.

So this year in 2013 we will see a heavier weighting towards restructuring benefits driving our gross productivity. So that is around 4%.
 We net that against the inflationary pressures that we see that range typically 2.5% to 3% inflation, that we want to stay ahead of.

It's a normal progression and it's sort of breaking through a threshold. You don't go through this type of thing unless you feel really good about the products that you're producing.

4996570_T,1,{8},"(Interpreted). Your question related to concern for people actually downgrading because of this introduction of the data unlimited or data relief plan, that if you pay KRW52,000 and if you on top of that pay KRW3,000 more then you of course would be getting KRW55,000 rate plan. At KRW55,000 rate plan, you're getting 250 gigabyte of data and if the user actually uses up to that level basically you would be receiving on an unlimited basis a data usage is possible at 450 kbps, not at the LTE speed rate. So LTE data usage is at 2.5 gigabyte. And if you look at KRW62,000 rate plan we basically provide 6 gigabyte.
 So down-selling is actually not very logical because you're a person who used to use a KRW62,000 rate plan and you still felt that that was insufficient. So for you to downgrade, that means that you are willing to sacrifice your speed at 400 kbps or much lower speeds than what LTE actually provides for data transmission. So if you're just Internet surfing, it may be okay. But for these heavy users, they would be using YouTube and very high-definition, high-quality video files. So this data speed at 450 kbps or much lower speed would not really satisfy these people who would be wanting these types of services. So considering all of these factors, there will be more up-selling impact rather than a downgrading impact.
 And one thing I would like to ask you to also note is that of course this new rate plan would provide us with an opportunity to up-sell and that would be an opportunity on our part. But this approach is not just for us to -- or also this is not on that aspect but to provide more options and more choice to our customers so that at the end of the day our customers could really benefit from these types of rate schemes rather than us trying to gain higher ARPU.
 Your question related to the future ARPU trajectory, we expect that for 2013 ARPU will grow 10% YOY. From a long-term perspective, up until when will the ARPU rise, it will be hard to forecast the specific number or the level. However, we see continuous growth of the LTE subs and their portion against the total cumulative base, and we plan to reach 75% of LTE subs out of the total base by the end of the year.
 So on average if we consider these types of trends, probably come next year or a couple of years later, we will see that most of our subs base will be accounted for by the LTE users. So the ARPU level will be converging or quite similar to the level of LTE ARPU. But with more growth and more increase in the number of LTE users, there would be potential reduction in the tariffs or maybe new data plans could be introduced so there is some room that ARPU could fall maybe slightly. But all in all we expect and forecast a very stable growth trend for ARPU.",train,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

Those deals have a tendency to be anywhere minimum of $500,000 on up to $1 million, $2 million, or several million dollars.

The other side is the more traditional campus -- medium-size campus and medium-size customers -- which can be more along the lines of $350,000 to $500,000 type of deals.

5000625_T,1,"{66,68,70}","Well, I think we're a little unique in that thing. And I think your comment is correct. I would call it a hardening market, not hard where it's an impossible market. Just hardening market where rates are going up and you're starting to see rates on rate. You're seeing disciplined underwriting. You're seeing renewals track higher, some of the things that we mentioned before.
 But I think when we look at our business and I think because of the niche we play in, and we've said this time and time again, we don't have to take our business up by 20%, 30%, 40% to make money. Look at we've been running the last couple of years in the market. The key for us is when the market gets hard, what gets us excited is there is a lot of the states, like New York and similar states where we've been doing business for years, what you tend to see is some of the large carriers, some of the package writers that have been competitors now start chasing the bigger, the hardening, the middle market and larger stuff and that leaves a lot more of the smaller business for us to go after.
 So we look at a hardening market for example in small commercials, especially small comp, we're looking to gain more market share. And ultimately that allows us to have a big book of business. And through the soft market, we were able to survive very healthy by having renewal rates because that smaller business sticks.
 So I think when we look at our return on equity business, our model is we want to be a high teen, low 20 return on equity business because everything we have, the discipline, the lower expense ratio, the niche business, the low hazard proponent to it, the fee business, the leverage, all that is what we look at as the business.
 So this is not something where -- we can end up being at 25% or 27% return on equity and we're not saying that. But we believe that we'll hopefully continue growing the lines of business, hopefully continuing leverage down our expense ratio, getting more of the business we like, and continuing to have a very healthy return on equity.

 And the other two primary sources of cash are going to be potential business development work and potential share repurchases. And both of those are really going to be kind of dictated due to market conditions and what opportunities that we have.

But it's being managed, and it's being watched very carefully by Michael and team, but I don't think it's appropriate doe us to disclose where we are in that process, how much we've recovered. I think the bottom line is we've taken the pain, and whatever we get afterwards that's just good news. [Boyd, HSBC Securities]. Just two questions. The first one around India, could you just contextualize it a little bit for us in terms of what you're seeing in terms of client numbers? And I suppose particularly interesting would be the amount of domestic clients you're attracting that aren't necessarily looking for the corridor leg, but just sort of purely retail in-country clients.
 And then a second question, just around your comments on the structured Tier I instrument, the clarity you're looking for from the SARB. Could you give some guidance on when you think you would get that clarity; and also, what your early interactions with your funders are in terms of possibly raising those? I'll do this, guys. Just on the structured, we expect two months to three months. On the funding, it's all in the margin. So its a supply and demand thing -- Ultimately, you can issue things at [silly] prices. So it's a question of where we believe fair value is versus where the market wants to take it from us. As far as India's concerned, remember that we only launched the retail and commercial banking business in India during the course of last year. In fact, we started to run a pilot in the second half of last year. The pilot is proving to be ahead of where we thought it would be.
 We're not at the stage where we're disclosing the customer numbers, but, you must understand, the pilot only runs in Mumbai at the moment. And because we are restricted in terms of the number of branches that we can have, we only have one branch. But we're using business correspondents, and we have about six sites that we are busy piloting within the business correspondent, which is allowed in terms of regulations in India. And those are doing particularly well.
 But we are still at the proof of contact, because the approach that we're using there is very different than anything that we've done anywhere in the world.
 We've completely used [detailed] platforms on the retail banking side. But from all the indications, it looks like we certainly have got something which is different from what everybody else in India is offering. Thank you, Mr. Nxasana. Mr. Nxasana, you asked for a round of applause for your team, and I can only say that it's well deserved.
 Let's just have a look, for instance, at your cash flow statement. Net cash flow inflow from operating activities over the last six months shows an increase of over 300%. If there's such a thing as an embarrassment of riches, your balance sheet shows that you've got ZAR14 billion more than you've required in recent historical times. So the immediate question is to what extent is that increase going to be sustainable into the future? That's question one, please. Thank you, sir. Question two deals with certain expenditure items. I'm particularly concerned -- interested in the item called other staff-related expenditure, an increase of ZAR755 million. Now, the notes to that, on page -- I can't make it out, sorry -- on a certain page, states that this has to -- that's a significant increase of 82% in IFRS 2 share-based payment expenses, linked to the increase in FirstRand share price during the period under review. May I ask for some explanation of that, please? I'm going to have a go at the other staff-related expenses; then we can always ask Alan to deal with that balance sheet question, he's also dying to say something.
 Now what we do is we have adopted the policy of not diluting our shareholders under our share scheme. So we've tried to hedge that growth in the share price by an instrument in the capital market. So what you have is as the share price grows the value to the staff grows, which means staff expenses goes up; but at the same time, the value of the instrument, the [hedgehog], also goes up.
 So the cost to the shareholder doesn't change. But because the instrument value goes up and down, and the value to staff goes up and down, you see these big movements in staff-related and other expenses. May I ask, that's all staff benefit, or is it only certain categories of staff? Obviously, the sale-of-shares scheme is one that is managed and controled by the regulation committee, which has covered a fair amount of detail in [their holding] statement, how the scheme works. But it wouldn't go down to all the individuals, but it goes down to a large part of the employees of the organization. On the balance sheet question, Alan? The interest, normally, over December we do allow the cash balances to increase to cover the festive season. There is also increases due to some excess foreign currency that we've had in countries like Nigeria, with the capital being invested there. And also, it also relates to client flow activities, where we've had to put money down for margin calls, and stuff. Indenting towards that increase. Is it going to increase by ZAR14 billion over the next period? I would have thought not. Thanks, Mr. Nxasana. Remaining with the expenditure, operating expenses, the last item on the table, and this time I can tell you it's on page 51, shows a substantial increase of 33%. Now, I realize that other expenditure comprises many items, but this is very substantial. It's over ZAR330 million. What brought that about? Included in that number is an example of ZAR250 million software impairment that we -- that Sizwe referred to in the corporate bank would be in that number, for example. But if you want more detail, I'm sure Alan can give you more detail on the breakdown. But a big number, there's a ZAR250 million impairment of the software development part in the corporate bank we wrote off in that line matter. Thank you.

5030717_T,1,{14},"I'll try and do that. On the first one, actually there has been a change; you mention you may not have followed it, Julian. The Secretary of State has changed the model, so the second wave, that was originally promised, it appears, right now, we'll wait and see, that we are the one company they've awarded work to. So we'll end up with five more out of that, as the preferred bidder now, effectively, for the South Yorkshire cluster.
 There were two, and we certainly only know of ours, at the moment, going ahead. So that's really good news for us. Those are five new prisons that we will get, and that will fuel some growth certainly for some time. So that's progressing.
 What the Secretary of State has done is actually used our vertical models of giving whole prisons, and he said, why don't we keep the estate, and we'll come back to that, because you'll also manage the estate differently for FM. Again a huge market for us.
 But could you deliver, for example, things to do reducing recidivism, so around rehabilitation services, teaching skills in prison that one can teach, education, language, and so on and so forth. We are, again, the leaders in that, and have scored about the highest, for what we know, in the programs that have been run previously. Previously, it was all self-contained in the prisons.
 So now we're developing models to take this horizontally, and they are starting to put those out. So I think it'll change. He's still going to put this work out, but he wants to do it this way rather than by prison, because I think he wants to build the capability across.
 The second, which will be a very big market, is the facilities management in prisons. They haven't put those out yet, but that is what the Secretary of State says he's going to do and, if so, we'll be very interested in that. None of that's in any pipelines or anything, right now. And he wants to move quickly, is the other thing he said. So we wait, with anticipation, to see how that market can even grow more significantly than it is.
 The other areas you mentioned, probation, actually we're the first people to get a probation contract. And that is in the Community Payback scheme, where magistrates will hand out a number of community hours as your sentence, if you like, and we are using that right now here in London. They believe that's anything from a GBP600 million to GBP1 billion per annum market. That is a very significant area. We are very interested in that, and we will continue to bid more as that comes out. So they are looking to put a pipeline out from there.
 You mentioned the traditional areas, and how we will allocate resource. We talked about the prison estate management. We do that today; we do it in the commercial sector; we do it for prisons today, so it will be people that we've got. Again, reminding you that most of the people we get for growth comes from the existing public sector. So we'll have the people there. What we'll put in is our technology, our reporting practices, a few less layers, and we will have that cadre, we've discussed before, that we move around to do phase-ins and startups.
 And with that sector, I have to say what we've not done in the UK is get rid of all the people that we could grow with. Even with the changes we had last year, we've made sure we keep people, because we knew that, if things work, we would see this bubbling starting through '13, into '14, and beyond. So I think we'll be reasonably placed to have enough of those people to bid them, to win them, and to phase them in. The operational people will be there who we'll work with, so we feel relatively comfortable about that.
 The allocation between the five new prisons will be the estate management we talked about, we talked about the, what I call, horizontals coming out, monitoring is another area, as you know, that's a big area for us, and the probation that we talked about. And there's some smaller work in occupational health, which we do today as well inside the prisons. So hope that gives you some color for that.
 And your final point on how we prepare to possibly reallocate resource. We made some changes to the business last year where, as you know, we made big changes around overheads. So I think we're in a place, right now, where we will need the people that I just mentioned, because this will go into '13, '14. My personal view is that we will be reasonably placed for that. We won't have a resource crisis in the business.
 The other good thing, with the public sector in particular, as you know, it's a 12 to 18-month cycle, so you get good visibility of what you need. So when you're bidding them, you know ahead. When you start getting down to the last three, and the last two, you have an idea, so you start ramping up in case you're going to win. And once you win, you have time before you phase it in.

I think everything we have done today I has been consistent with that approach.
 I think we get earnings power through continued reduction in credit cost which we have outlined today. We have a very focused effort on expense management. I think our entire industry is facing a revenue problem. But I think we've taken out $120 million in cost over the last two years. I think that is reflective of a very disciplined expense management program and we will continue to do that until the revenue line heals. And quite frankly when that heals we will still be very disciplined on the expense side.
 And then I think today we talked about how we believe the balance sheet is at or near a trough and we will see reported loan growth in the back half of the year. And so, you will have credit costs coming down, you will have expenses going down, you will have a revenue going up and I believe that is what leads you to the kind of multiple that allows you to just buy your independence.

We were running well over 2% for most of last year, and especially it was especially high in the fourth quarter. We are now down slightly below 2% the last month in March.

I say relatively stable. Right now, we're in a bit of compression. It really -- the movement within a relatively tight band has been largely a function of where we are in an inflationary cycle. So, the biggest change right now that you're seeing in the gross margins -- headwinds to margin are nothing new to the business. There's always been some -- for a while, there's been mix changes and mix elements that have put pressures on gross margin and those have been offset through price and through strategic programs. Now, it happens to be a big one.
 You're right, we've had an anniversary some of the bolt-on businesses. Without the noise of those, the big headwind certainly now has been vending and the vending, along with other normal, like large account mix, gets offset by pricing plus strategic programs. I think what you see from us is that early in an inflationary cycle, you're going to see the tail winds exceed the headwinds pretty significantly and you see expansion. And as you get later in a cycle, what we're seeing is the headwinds are exceeding the tail winds because the headwinds haven't changed all that much. But on the tailwind side of the equation, we've got significant less contribution from price, even though we continue to execute on the program. So, I would say that's still our intent.

They are very engaged and spend a lot of time with us. We have an ad format that works on mobile and we have identities so that we can put the right ads in front of the right people.
 So I think the future for us is, I think, much more interesting than trying to project it from any particular quarter at this point, just because we've got a lot left to do.

The recognition for me is that I can't travel to the four corners of the country as I was doing, and I need to spend slightly less, emphasis on slightly less, time at Panera.

 What we see as an opportunity in some markets is to use celebrities to strengthen certain aspects of our brand. So, it may be for Avon, but it might be, for example -- Fergie is a good example where we would have Fergie as our celebrity endorsement. I think what we see the bigger opportunities, rather than have a global celebrity approach, is really to look at a local celebrity approach. We want the hierarchy and the architecture of the brand to be consistent globally. But how we execute against that, we will look at different avenues. And that's where I see us using celebrity endorsement versus looking at the highest level on a total basis. And if I could just add to what Sheri said. And what we've seen in a couple of examples of that is that, frequently, the local celebrity, not only is it more relevant and more effective, but it's a lower cost than some of the global celebrities.

 And when you spend more at the edge or in the ran the antenna technology and build next gen wireless network, that's thinking a lion share of the investment dollars. And therefore, the carrier shifts more into that segment at a consequences of other segment in the industry.
 Well, we're been going through that for the last couple of years. We're getting to the end of it in North America or in the third year (inaudible) start tailing off already in the fourth year. So it will be strong this year and then tails down next year, no shift [there] dollars than into other segments.
 Optical Networking is needed because when you build more bandwidth at the edge or allow for more bandwidth at the edge to the mobile user, you're going to need more core bandwidth to support that. And therefore, it's a food chain and right now, the infrastructure [and area where] people are continuing to build out but they're driving pricing down. And there's not enough let's say focus on this space or global national build outs to have a big impact on our industry. But that will shift like I said. They can run networks hotter for only some period of time.
 And therefore, basic assumptions around the what we see as the lack cluster environment and if you look through and you look at the Broadcom, and you talk to the FPGA players, the people that are selling components into networking as a whole, Q1 was not a strong year, our strong quarter.
 It's seems to be strengthening some. So some of the assumptions are around market data, competitors, suppliers and of course our customers and we build our assumptions. And right now, we feel that Q2 is going to be better than Q1. But it's not growing rapidly just yet and hoping for a very strong second half.
 That's market related. I'd like to reiterate one thing though.

I think part of what we have going on, Nat, is where our systems gather so much information and we are able to mine that data to market more efficiently, to market what people want. So some of that spending is just to improve the systems and that helps us market better. I would also say that any time we grow in the fourth quarter our first quarter tends to have a nice tailwind to it. So the fact that last year's fourth quarter was back on an upswing, I think lead to the blocking and tackling of the first quarter paying off better than usual. Patrick? I would agree with that. I will also turn it over to Dave to whom Marketing now reports. I will mention we have found arbitrages. Now that we have really good information better than we have ever had. I would say in the past really we have been spending a lot of time building the systems, but they were still at the point where they spit out reports and people looked at the reports and tried to make decisions, but now so much of it has become real time... Big data driving it almost without human intervention all kinds of things. Having closed that loop is a big part of this as is just the data has gotten so good we are finding arbitrages in the system, maybe not like we found ten years ago, where you could find these big gaping holes of things being mispriced out there in advertising.

His approach is fantastic with probing and testing and taking all of this big data and developing some of these strategies to be able to speak directly to our customers and their individual tastes. Go ahead, Patrick. No go ahead finish. I am sorry. I thought you were done. He has brought yet another element. So as Jonathan said, the blocking and tackling and promotional cadence has been very good, but it's nice to have that addition of technology and innovation. I mentioned, last year I mentioned publicly, probably nine months ago, we started a group called O Labs. Stephen Tryon, Colonel Stephen Tryon, my great friend, built it, and it was really just what it sounded like. Saum was a developer, actually a java coder, and then a director of development. Then he came into O Labs and got a lot of things done under Stephen Tryon, so it was kind of a strange move some thought to move him into SVP of Marketing.

5062297_T,1,{3},"Thanks, Kian. I think a couple of good questions. From today's perspective, to answer your first question on the EUR434b, I would say that we should think about it a little bit lower now. Currently if we look at the business opportunities I think that we would see this a notch lower, certainly above the EUR380b level, but lower than the EUR434b. That's our current thinking. And when we look at the appetite that the business has and what the business needs in order to fulfill their target, it's in between these numbers.
 And then you asked me on the 10%. Obviously I don't think it takes a genius to calculate that we have really gotten very close to the 10%. Nevertheless, we want to preserve our optionality and therefore obviously we have not given an update on this target. But you can assume that obviously we are inside of this 10%. It was important for us to be inside of this 10%. So we've fully taken the capital concern off the table. So for right now, let's stay with our guidance. But I would say we're pretty sure that we'll achieve this target by 2015 now.
 Then on FBO, we -- I would say that I described to you in previous calls that we think that we can -- even the worst-case scenario of these rules were to come in place, that we had a plan put together to meet the requirements, that especially the leverage requirements and that because for these leverage requirements, tier 1, tier 2 instruments can be used, we feel very comfortable that we will be able to -- doing this swap of debt to equity and especially then eventually debt to equity-like instruments, achieve what we need to do in the United States.
 The problem that remains though to the FBO are still unclear. We haven't learnt any additional. The proposal is out and we have commented on the proposal. You've seen a lot of lobbying going around and we are now awaiting until we can see the final route. So therefore I regretfully have no update for you.

5064858_T,1,"{53,54,55,56,57,59}","Okay. Just on the first one, we have seen an important effect. In fact, I would say to you that you know, in some of those early numbers, or some of the comments that we made during the, you know, road shows, this is what I meant about, you know, having a positive surprise.
 In other words, we're getting, we're getting those sort of, those sort of churns on the convergence customers already, and in fact, in some cases, even slightly better.
 So in that sense, that's what I meant by a positive, a positive, you know, news, particularly on the last, the last two months of the quarter, particularly last month and particularly some of the more recent, you know, batches, or call them harvests, as we call them internally in Jazztel.
 So I, we are seeing a tremendously improved churn rate. Also, I think it has to do with the fact that we're getting a very good percentage of higher minutes, you know, what we call the, you know, the middle and the high end, but first in the convergence, right, the 300 and the 600 minutes packages, we're getting a very good upside, we're getting a very good sort of sales rate on those, right, as opposed to some of the low end.
 Which I guess adds to the profit to the better churn as well, so we are, you know, we are, we are satisfied. We are happy with, you know, with everyone, right, because it's a, it's a better sort of -- than we expected, and I think that's having a slightly -- and now it's still, it's still, we still have a lot of work, right?
 So, you know, obviously, it is positive because, you know, we, to some extent we anticipated this effect and we spoke to you guys all about it, and so these effects that I'm mentioning are very good, but obviously, we still have a lot of work to do and but it's good to, it's good to give you this feedback, even if it's, even it's on the conference.
 Now, on the -- we've looked at some of those laws, and as you know, Fernando in Spain, that's been, there's always been all sorts of, you know, initiatives so you know, we need to, we are analyzing you know, these initiatives, which by the way, they're still, you know, it blows their initiatives, they still have to go through a lot of, a lot of development.
 And as you can expect, you know, the -- I mean, we can always, we can always, you know, we can always accommodate new initiatives. In fact, many of these laws, we've had discussions with the Ministry about them, and to talk about some of the inherent issues that we all want to improve, in terms of the customer experience.
 So, but there's still a lot of work to be done, because on the other hand, you know, and I, I'm always very wary about some of the things that get written up, because, you've got, you know, thousands of jobs all around Spain, right, from, you know, the whole sector, everybody uses telesales, everybody uses platforms in Spain, you know, every, every single operator.
 So there is always a very, a very delicate discussion about how those laws can affect not only sales channels but also jobs all around the country. So I would say to you that we are looking at some of these initiatives. In fact many of them has been initiated by the industry ourselves.
 We've spoken, you know, operators have spoken to each other about this issue, and we've discussed with the Ministry, and we talked about how can improve the, how we can improve things. But these laws generally need quite a lot of time before they get, you know, before they get really embedded.
 And even when they get embedded, the laws need to contemplate also, all sorts of aspects like for example, the no-destruction of jobs. As you know, it's a very important aspects in, at the moment.
 Nonetheless, these initiatives or this law does not affect our guidance and our confidence on net adds and sales, right, so just to give you, just to give you full confidence that it doesn't affect, it doesn't give us any, you know, any concern on that. Just Fernando, one, I shall comment to your concern about this type of contract. We are sending a logistic and people to your home (inaudible). We can get, you know, the contract signed and as you know, we have all this.
 We send the contract to the customer. It is house [trade], you want to need, you know, to get this contract or not? (Inaudible). We already delivered a contract to the customers, and we already have it. That's why I said to you that you know, I think the Ministry is concerned in some of the, I would say more sort of peripheral type operations in the market. But you know, the way that Jazztel works is a very highly, a very highly professional platforms, with tremendously strict on a, you know, on a per-sale basis, and on a personal basis.
 So we have our own, for example, 10 page code of practices, right, which call out, you know, all our platforms must comply, and where all of these issues get completely, fully managed. And as Ramon says, you know, we, this is why I said to you that we don't see any, this law does not affect, you know, Jazztel's you know, guidance or confidence in terms of future sales or future growth. Yes, even we don't have a permanent period. I mean, the customers, you know, is not happy with the contract, they can go away. Yes. Yes, there's been, I mean there's been, we've been talking with Ministry for years, actually. I've been talking for about five years, actually so there is, there is obviously discussions, but those discussions obviously, need to look at many, many different scenarios, many different channels, many different companies, many different sectors.
 So it's always very complex to not, you know, to define anything concrete.

We continue to push each and every day on how to lower costs for the clients, the members that we serve. Part of that is through how we go back and work with either branded manufacturers or generic manufacturers to lower cost or increase the rebate yield and I think we continue to be pretty successful in that area. It's probably not one answer at the end of the day. There's a lot of things that are across our business that we're doing. Whether that be changes in our formulary, whether that be changes in our UM program, whether it be how we tailor our programs to drive value in this area. So there's two ways to drive value. One is through rebates which the vast majority of that value gets passed to our clients and we do that through our formulary strategy which has been very successful, and making sure appropriate branded drugs are available. But we negotiate very aggressively with manufacturers to bring the net costs down for our clients. The other thing is with all the generics that have come to the market over the last couple years, there are now in most therapeutic categories enough generics to provide appropriate level of care. So we also have available for our clients what we describe as a value formulary which limits even further branded drugs that are available and boosts the overall generic fill rate across that client's book of business and delivers savings in that way.

But certainly we've seen the Gulf pick up in terms of interest in the Gulf, and particularly in the deepwater area. So we're hopeful that we're going to get to a price with Medusa. Sure. Again, we're finishing up the fourth well on a four-well pad in Taylor Draw now. And we'll be finished with it this week, actually, or middle of next week.

5075537_T,1,"{19,20}","First, Joerg here again, I apologize. I hadn't quite understood the question of Kamran before. It referred not to Germany, but to Turkey, our premium income in Turkey. This is under some pressure, because we introduced new tariffs and were quite strict with our underwriting policies.
 Therefore, we see it, I would say, with -- with a -- we welcome that development that the quality of the portfolio improves, at the moment, at the cost of the size. So, this is okay.
 Second, on the guidance for the net profit for the full year, yes, there are some positive factors, obviously, from the first quarter, from property/casualty reinsurance and from life insurance. Offsetting factor, one I haven't mentioned only in very general terms, that could be the development from Windsor Health, which hasn't been quantified yet. Therefore, we are a bit careful, but if you ask me how confident I am and how does this compare to our stance in March, then I would say we are more confident than we were two months ago that we would make that target.
 Torsten? Yes, good afternoon. New capacity -- in detail, there's a lot of noise, a lot of discussions in the market about the institutional investors, particularly the [pendulum] funds, which have come into our reinsurance market, particularly in the cat business, over the last six to eight months.
 The -- I think it's important and we try to do this, to analyze a bit deeper what is their competitive advantage? What is their strategy, their business model, and how can that compete against the traditional sort of reinsurance model?
 We think it's not completely new that new capacity came into the market after hardening of cat rates after severe cat events in the past. Remember, the various waves of new capacity coming into the Bermuda market after 1992, after 2001, and so on. So, it's not a completely new phenomenon.
 What is new this time is that, particularly the Pendulum funds, came into the market because of the difficulties to invest in the current market environment. And what they do is, they do not invest into Bermudians or into other traditional reinsurance or insurance companies, they participate with their capital on a sort of direct basis in our cat treaties.
 Why that? Because I think they want to avoid the usual market risk, which they would -- which they would participate otherwise in case of traditional investments in our industry.
 A big question mark is how sustainable is it, and what happens after severe losses. There are a lot of speculations in the market. We are of the opinion that some of the capacity, particularly the qualified players, will stay in the market, others might disappear.
 We have also asked the question is it -- do these investors have the structural competitive advantage against the traditional reinsurance model in the cat business? We came to the conclusion, and that is, maybe, interesting for you. As long as we act in a qualified way, traditional reinsurance and the new capacity, this new capacity has no systemic advantage price-wise.
 Why is that? Because in reinsurance -- in the traditional reinsurance model you offer capacity with capital which is diversified. The institutional investors, they offer collateralized capacity, which means, from the buyer's perspective there is no credit risk. On the other hand, it means from the pendulum fund's view, that they have to provide 100% capital for 100% of capacity.
 If you make a pricing equation between the two, then the resulting return is only in the highest peak zones comparable with the traditional reinsurance model. In other zones, in less-exposed zones, the new capacity should be more expensive, yes, because of the collateralization.
 This is, however, under the assumption that they use the same models for the same frequency and severity assumptions. We made the observation that a lot or most of the institutional investors provide capacity by using the Applied Insurance Research model from AIR. I don't say that this is the wrong model, I just say it's, among all available models, the cheapest one. So, in that respect, they can have an advantage, if they use more optimistic assumptions about future losses.
 Has that -- has this new capacity an impact on the Munich Re? Of course, it has. You mentioned new capacity leads to more competition and, to some extent, particularly for the United States cat business, we do expect more competition in the July 1 renewal, which will, at least for the Munich Re, partly be offset by improving rates, primary rates, in which we participate through our proportional participations.
 And then, long term, we think we have to respect this capacity, at least as long as it stays in the market, however, we at the Munich Re, we offer -- we have a different business model in place. We offer capacity together with service, anyhow, and I think here we can and will differentiate from this capacity which now comes into the market.

We have already made, in arithmetic terms, GBP422m of gross realizations which the 15% to 20% can be applied to. If you do the arithmetic on that, it sort of accounts for, I guess, our base level of dividend. So everything going forward now is going to represent arithmetic that will generate a special distribution. We have a strong pipeline of realizations in progress and to come, so I'm optimistic that we will be saying more about that towards the end of the year.
 I didn't get the phone call that you mentioned, although that was my mobile ringing so that could have been him. I was playing golf on Saturday morning and I was having a sneaky cooked breakfast in the club house with my three playing parties, away from my wife's disapproving look, when I got handed the FT on Saturday morning and there was an article in the FT that said ""F&C hit by big protest over pay"". And this was handed to me by a very senior board member of one of our largest fund management groups, who was in my four ball.
 And I'll just read the first three paras of this. F&C Asset Management, the UK's worst performing listed fund management group, had suffered a large protest vote over company pay yesterday and lost another big investor. Some 25% of votes cast did not back the company's remuneration report for 2012 over concerns about the performance of the Group, which has struggled to attract new business. The big protest was one of the largest among FTSE 250 companies recently, and sent the company share price tumbling and made worries about more investor defections.
 So I've got that. I was ribbed about that as I was teeing off. And I looked at the share price performance since Mr. Branson became Chairman of F&C and I've looked at the activities of here, and I'm afraid I just don't get it.

 There's a lot of money being spent. There's no doubt there's some discombobulation, particularly at the state level as we've got this semi-recession floating around. Remember, we're not a dominant player in infrastructure and so on the engineering, construction and project management assignments that we are chasing every day, as we look at our prospect list and we have cornered our sales managers in this business because we read the same junk you do and they frankly can sell all the work that we can staff, okay. 
 And I've got in that conversation and we've had lots of meetings in the past couple months where we've had contact with these guys including the annual business review and then our annual meeting just a couple weeks ago for the senior management. 
 In the infrastructure business they can sell all they can staff; it's that simple, both in the UK and in the US. In the buildings business I think it's a little more complex in terms of a lot of the work we do does not seem to be caught up in any of these funding issues. 
 The Justice Department--a lot of it's--first of all, a lot of the work is federal. The stuff that is not federal is tied up in local school issues and places like that. And as you know, the school business from first to K12 and then at the secondary, at the college level, there's just a lot of activity going on because we're short of schoolhouses all over the country. 
 And then you look at the piece of business that's in research hospitals and things like that and while I won't say they're immune to the economy, they're close. 
 So in the infrastructure business, I guess we're not big enough to be hurt. And in the buildings business we're in a market that is not being severely impacted.

So we started to initiate some of those changes to the sales group in late Q2 and throughout Q3. 
 And I've got to say that, considering that it takes typical three to six months for a new sales rep to ramp up, we've already been making some good progress with some of the those individuals who joined in the October time frame. So I would have to say that, looking forward, we're not, as you know, providing next quarter revenue guidance, but longer term, I'm very optimistic about getting back to growth and seeing the company achieve its longer-term revenue growth expectations and profitability. But there's no doubt in Q3, we did experience some reduction, if you will, from revenue in the sense that we did have to make some changes, as was evident in our Q2 results. 
 But I'm very, very confident that today we have a very highly experienced team that knows how to sell successfully through all phases of the business cycle, good economy, poor economy, and we're already seeing the results of some of those individuals kicking in. And, of course, we have Don Pope. That was announced in the latter part of Q3.

That primarily` relates to a new sales planning tool we have in place and we're having, you know, in terms of the process on that -- we don't think that --- we think that's more of a temporary increase and we're working to bring that down.

722630_T,1,{7},"Yes we do. Percentage may go down as Comcast rises, but I would expect that they will be a 10 plus percent and the volume of purchases will continue to be strong from Cox as the year goes on. With regard to the guidance, clearly we anticipated that question. I think the street consensus was 133 at that time, and when we look now with three weeks of additional information, we are dealing with the few things here that, I think, they are upon us and cause us to be conservative in our guidance for the quarter. First of all, the Capex environment is incredibly tight. Our customers are delaying purchases wherever they can. They are doing very little forecasting and they are doing very little advance ordering of products leading to a short book to ship interval shorter than we have ever seen it. If I kind of go back a year ago and look at what AT&T who was a 40 percent customer if you recall at that time we had a good visibility with that customer. 
 Now, they are replaced by Comcast, which we really have low visibility on, primarily, I think, because of the merger effect and probably a little bit about the way they do business. Secondly, we are finding more everyday that they don't know and we don't know how of much inventory there is out in the field and this affects both sales to Adelphia and to Comcast. Both of them as you know were on fairly aggressive construction programs that were interrupted well over a year ago and now they are starting them up. I think we and other vendors have expected that things would pick up a little bit faster than they have and I think part of the reason for that aside from the weather that occurred in the first quarter, but part of the reason for that is the fair uncovering cashes of inventory in the field and the last thing, I say about it is that this Cabovisao situation is a fairly big swinger for us. We have got $6 to $ 7 million sitting in backlog that we are holding if indeed in May they get their new funding and we will be able to ship that stuff pretty quickly, but if not we won't and right now, we don't have it in our forecast.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

 As far as SARS, the war, et cetera, one of the things that I found, and I certainly invite John Pleasants and Erik or David Litman, Bob Diener, to talk about this relative to ticketing and travel, what we've seen, despite war, despite fears of SARS, which certain affected us in Canada, but not for very long, that we are able to, because we are able to surmount these issues that go beyond normal commerce, normal life, and we now have done it in -- we think it's quite remarkable since 9/11, the after effect of 9/11 in terms of our travel, people going to outdoor, indoor venues, to -- for entertainment, sports and things. The effect was sharp but incredibly short. So I don't think -- I don't know what might have colleagues have to say, but I say it by certainly holding our breath by saying well, you know, you could get some terrible event that would happen and react to that obviously differently. But I don't see any of these events as having an appreciable impact upon what we do. Any differing opinion from my colleagues? Victor, this is John Pleasants, I would only add to that, in terms of the ticketing business, it actually served as kind of an accelerator for the first quarter. The one thing we did see is many of our clients and promoters took some of the on-sales that they were planning on launching the beginning of the second quarter and accelerated them to the timing just before the war. And some of that contributed to the really bang-up quarter that we had in time period Ticketmaster. There was a timing shift did due to the war, but ticketing has proven to be resilient both during this war as well as 10 years ago during the first Gulf war. I think we may have in our Match business seen a slight effect. We had a strong first quarter in match but we did see the back end of the first quarter fall off in Match a little bit in terms of the amount of new subscribers coming in. It's hard to prove, you've got advertising going off and on in different cities, a lot of difficulty to pin the causality, but I would say the war mood, I think, made people not so eager to go run and consider their dating initiatives and desires. It wasn't a pick fall off, but got softer right when the war started. I think it had a slight impact on the match making business but in terms of local services, it really didn't affect us at all. From the Expedia side, if you like, it's Erik Blachford. We think that our bookings our gross bookings in March probably would have been about $75 million higher absent the war, and towards the very end of the month, I guess, SARS as well. So that's not all going to be reflected in terms of revenue in the first quarter because of the way we recognized revenue on Merchant is on stay, not on bookings. Some of that will be in Q2. Also the impact of SARS for us has been pretty small. Business going in and out of Asia is not a big part of our Expedia's business. I don't think we'll see a lot. In general, as Greg said before, we're not really updating the budget we're tracking well against it. Despite all those. Hotels.com, it's Bob Diener here, a very similar comment, we saw some effects due to the war, they were fairly small, somewhere in the 2 to 3% range of revenues, mainly affected international travel.

Because of its association, AIB's association with Corry, we're able to bring over night vision capability to that operation.

 And the last thing I'd say is, as that loss ratio at which you're booked, you've got the thing booked, keeps going up. You're -- at least I feel like you're starting to address, and you're starting to be able to bake in the experience of our original clients. I think it was two quarters ago, you might remember me saying that as our insurance clients that we wrote reinsurance for, as they come to terms with the appropriate levels of reserves on their original policies that they sold, as they change their mind, as they take their reserve charges, etc., there's a trickle down effect as that flows through to our book. 
 I think most of the industry, the insurance industry, has sort of gotten their arms around what has been an incredibly difficult series of accident years. '99, 2000, 2001. So that's in our favor, too. Let me tell you what's not in our favor, because -- to paint a balanced picture I have to do that. Frequency and severity of the general liability claims, during those accident years, differed substantially from the accident years that preceded them. 
 That makes actuarial methods, which inherently rely on some version of the past is a good predictor of the future -- when you say that fundamentally the game changed with the court system, etc., that adds uncertainty, that adds risk. I think investors, and certainly we and our actuaries are cognizant of that risk when we set those reserves. And should be cognizant of those risks.

767631_T,1,{7},"Sure. No problem. At the beginning of this year, we gave guidance that our interest expense would be approximately €1.2m for the year. Now the €0.8m basically arises out of two postings. One posting relates to the agreement that we had with XOMA. This agreement we had with XOMA, we had an option of paying with cash or shares. And according to US GAAP accounting, when we actually raised the shares for XOMA, we would have to recognize what in essence is a king of interest expense related to this conversion, which in this case amounted to roughly €600,000 or so. And that's a non-cash charge on the income statement, which again relates only to the raising of shares to XOMA and will not reoccur. Again, I want to stress that it's non-cash.
 The other piece of the €0.8m, approximately €0.2m relates to the agreement that we have with CAT. As you may recall, we had approximately €5m which was booked as part of the settlement agreement last year with CAT, that we have to pay them over the next five years at the rate of €1m per year. And how we booked that liability was that we booked it at a net present value, which means that every year we have to amortize, effectively, what is this loan to CAT on this outstanding liability. So, what you see in there is an interest-related charge on that liability, which is not in addition to the €1m, but is inside the €1m that we pay them every year.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

We have done particularly well in regional chains and in club stores, but you get one of these accounts and you are talking 200-800 stores. Any one of these could be a big blip and have impact in the short-term or it may just take a while to roll this thing out.

795957_T,1,"{3,5,6}","Safar, that's actually - -that's a great question, because we spent about three hour two weeks ago in my staff meeting with the top 35 executives in the company actually going over just exactly that. So, I can give you an answer that is both fresh in my mind and also well baked internally. 
 From a broadband standpoint, I have said - - Safar you know cause you've been on the call - - for the past year and a half I have sat on earning calls and my belief was that the broadband industry would have to bring its prices down into the $20 to $30 range in order to get any growth beyond the early adapter, the tech savvy and the affluent in the businesses and in fact they have started to do that. 
 What I find particularly intriguing is that the messaging that they are using - - and again, this is a marketing issue. This is not anything beyond that. The messaging that they are using is devoid of any mention of the speed of the product. Let me enlighten. When people hear that there is a $26.95 or $21.95 broadband product, those of us who may be paying $80 or $90 a month for broadband because we need the 1.5 megabit broadband that we've all come to know, people look at a $26.95 price point and they go 'this is incredible, I should go and sign up for this right away', number one, hard to get, number two you'd find out it's really not the broadband that you know as high speed broadband, it's a 384, 128 product, which a lot of people call what you've referenced as 'broadband light.' 
 So, what's happening is they're using the marketing cleverly to get people to sign up - - and by the way, I think they've done a good job because the broadband market is starting to grow. So, what happens is, the premium dial-up customer says well 'whether I can or I can't get the $26.95 or the $29.95 broadband, there is no reason for me to continue to pay $23.90 a month or $21.95 a month for dial-up because it will just be a matter of time until I could get this lower priced broadband and so it's working to our advantage, which we thought it would because it's shaking the apple roots from the tree. 
 It's basically saying for those people who want the broadband product, they are going to go try to get it, you know it's got a lot of spotty coverage. So, what happens is they have now become dissatisfied with paying a high price for dial-up, so, when they come down to the value segment and sort of hang out there, until and unless they can get an attractively priced broadband product, when they get there Safar, we have the ability to sell them on our high-speed dial-up product, which frankly from a surfing standpoint are not much different than what you're getting for $26.95 from SBC Yahoo! DSL. 
 So, we are actually being helped in my view, and the numbers would bear me out by our growth rates, we're being helped by what's going on in the broadband market. My view a year from now is that more and more broadband companies will be in this broadband light category. So they will get growth, premium dial-up will continue to decline at accelerating rates and the value segment of the ISP market, as I stated before, will become a larger and larger segment of the market and we as the market leader with a 487 employee base and a construct to do this should logically become the beneficiary. 
 Ironically, a benefit that I didn't plan on which came out in our cyber target research which is why 12.3% of the people in the study came to us on high speed from Broadband is that the more people who sign up for low price Broadband Light the greater the potential for dissatisfaction with the Broadband product because it isn't the speed product that everybody has known to come and hear about. So ironically while it doesn't help premium dial up it may in fact help our accelerated dial up services because once people get this intoxicated need for speed and they're not really getting much of it with Broadband light we may actually find that they say well for this kind of speed, I should go try this accelerated dial up product. So that's our thesis, we've been right so far, hopefully we'll continue to be right in the future. The market dynamics and the recent trends would indicate that we are right on and we love where we sit. You know Saffa it's interesting; advertising which used to be 100% of our revenues is now about 10% of our revenues. The good news is all of the mechanisms that we had in place back in the heyday of the advertising industry online are still there. We do see the advertising industry starting to pick up and we do see the search industry as a tremendous opportunity over the next several years. We feel that both our user base in terms of their usage habit and the general search industry have indicators that would suggest to us that that's going to be an even better business 24 months ---12 months from now than even it is today. So we're excited about the opportunity within the search category as it relates to our brand and we also believe that should the trend on the internet advertising market continues because of the unique products that we're able to offer and the size of our user base that we should be in a very good position to capitalize on that. Yes Saffa what I would add this is Charles is ---we've got a potentially to meet our transition within our advertising revenue that we need to work through the first being the expiration the GM contract at the end of this quarter that were pretty up in inventory and as you've mentioned spot pricing is getting better and we hope and believe that we'll continue to do that. And the other is as I mentioned more in act of negotiation with the incumbent overture Yahoo with both number of other party on where our search business will replace and went forward. So we remain very intrigued by the opportunity that presents itself there and I will say lets stay tuned and see how we transition though the GM deal with the economic put back on this new search deal before we began adjusting numbers.",train,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

You know, I thought to myself at times that was kind of an aggressive projection, but I think if things keep going the way that they're going we may well hit the 25%, and where it goes from there, we're not sure, but we don't think that it's unreasonable that over time, we can get it up to 40% to 50% and do it in an efficient manner.
 There's really -- I want to emphasize there are two reasons to do this. One is financial. You're able to shift (ph) your fixed costs to variable costs. And what hurts us isn't so much the busy days, when we're efficient, but there are days of the week and days of the month where we're not that busy. So there's cross shift, but also we're shifting it at the parties that are closer to the customer and actually are able to provide better customer service to those customers.
 As a result, we become easier to do business with, and we believe that an ancillary benefit is going to be to increased sales. So we will work very hard towards it. We don't think 40% to 50% is out of the realm of possibility. Yeah, the only of difference was the timing of our advertising. I don't have it in front of me, but fourth quarter I believe will be down somewhat because we're just not running as much advertising.
 As you look at next year, I wouldn't look for those costs to increase on the sales and marketing line or not much at all. Although, within those categories, what we are going to do, we said I think last quarter or the quarter before that we've taken a lot of the investment spend that we looked at over the last couple of years and we're evaluating what worked and what didn't.
 So within sales and marketing, we're sort of saving money in some areas but we are going to increase our advertising. So while the dollars themselves will be relatively flat, advertise something clearly a good contributor to our growth and we're going to emphasize that a little bit more. Keith will give that to you.

 So, our first year with Widmer in 2003 was a partial year. For the year 2004 it will be a full year. And it already had a positive impact on the volume in the East Coast, which you know has been an area of some friction over the years because we have the big facility there and we have our sales force. And the volume was too light and it wasn't growing particularly fast. 
 So, I follow your question and I think that thinking in terms of the East, which we don't breakout for accounting purposes. We do analyze it, but we don't disclose it because these calls would take too long. But positive for the East. Now, we're also going to have a partial year phenomenon in entering into this alliance - Craft Brands Alliance. So, there's a fair number of moving parts going on, but I think they are all positive. Hi, Paul. Hi, Ted. How are you? Listen, you really featured this whole thing about Widmer. Now, here we don't know Widmer for beans. And I'd like to have some idea since they're going to be a very important element here and going in the future. 
 I'd like to know - are they are small corporation? Are they privately held? Are they held by a few people? What kind of finances have they got? And the fact that you're mentioning Board agreement almost looks like you're skirting the ""M"" word, which is OK. But, you know, and does this figure into the big fat $16.2 million problem that we've got and you haven't been talking about? OK. Let me start ... One more question, Paul. OK. Do any of these chaps own Redhook stock? Because it looks like somebody has been sucking it up a bit. And that would be kind of interesting because it would give a little - kind of an idea about their attitude toward Redhook. OK. Ted, the Widmer Brothers - their brewery in Portland in 1984. They are from Oregon. I have known them all the way back to 1984. They are a private company. They have Anheuser-Busch as a minority investor, but virtually all of the other ownership of the company is in that family. 
 Kurt and Rob are the brothers. They are very solid people. People that you would - I promise you, you would like these guys. They are brewers first and foremost. They are very well known in the brewing industry by virtue of their leadership in the hefeweizen category. 
 Their brewery was recently brewery of the year. Declared brewery of the year in the micro brewery category in the Great American Beer Festival. So, we're dealing with people who we know and people who have a similar point of view about the industry to us. And people with whom you would like to be associated. 
 The Widmer brothers to my knowledge have no stock in Redhook Brewery. But the topic is of interest and has been discussed and will be part of the deal as to exactly and to what circumstances and how much they could acquire. 
 Now, as far as the A-B deal and the $16 million and the anniversary. You know, the progress that we made on the Widmer Craft Brands Alliance deal was quite dramatic progress in the last few weeks. And rose to the level which required disclosure. And you know, that's why we're disclosing it, obviously. 
 The A-B deal, we have made progress. The level of progress was not sufficient to merit inclusion in the press release. So, the distinction is a small one. We definitely have made progress versus where we were last quarter. 
 As I said last quarter in this call, the resolution of our agreement with Anheuser-Busch is a top priority for me. And we have been working on it. We have met. We have discussed. We've made progress. 
 When the progress is sufficient, we will produce a press release to that effect. Anything else, Ted? Just my frustration with the fact that no more stores are carrying Redhook in this New Hampshire area that I'm in. And we've had friends that have said oh, the hell with it. They can't get what they want and they buy Sam Adams. And that really frustrates me. Well, that bugs me too because the rubber hits the road at distribution. And I know the area that you're talking about. It's an area of New Hampshire that's influenced - it's influenced by Vermont somewhat. But that particular wholesaler in that area, while he's improved, still has a way to go to catch up with how we're doing down on the coast. 
 You know, down in Portsmouth we are a real factor. And we made a lot of progress this year in New Hampshire. But I hear you and it's an area where we want to be a factor. OK. Well, thank you. You bet. Good morning, Paul and Dave. Good morning. First of all, I'd like to congratulate your management team on the formation of the joint sales and marketing organization. I expect the efficiencies gained to be a positive for both companies. 
 How large is Widmer's operations here on the West Coast? I'm familiar with the brand. They're a very popular brand here in the Northwest. The report in the ""Oregonian"" today described Widmer as a 180,000 barrels plus or minus on the West Coast, which, you know, is similar in size to us in the West. So, you put the two brands together you've got quite a lot of volume relative to our category. And can I add one further question on that. What does Widmer do well in marketing and sales? And what do they bring to this? Are there things that they do well in particular? Yes, Fred (ph), you know, we've had a chance to observe the Widmer operation as competitors. And we've had a chance to work with them in terms of our licensing agreement in the East. 
 And the way that I'd answer that question is that I think that they are highly organized. They're focused. They have a very practical approach to the selling and marketing of beer. They have strict cost controls and they have a care about how they spend that I think we're going to learn from. 
 I think that without criticizing the way that we've done, we have focused in on building our brands and drawing a line in the sand and protecting volume. And the Widmer organization has done that, candidly, with greater success. 
 And so, when we came to the conclusion that it was appropriate to form a joint venture - jointly owned selling and marketing company - the conclusion was that the leadership from Widmer would be the logical leadership for that company.

On the mid-markets I think in Europe already in 2003 we have gained, on average in Europe we have gained market share in the mid-market, not in the U.S. here, but I think we are organized now in all the elements in the sales organization, in e-commerce, in special catalogs, to become stronger there going forward. In the private label business we have grown in Europe over the year, in the U.S. we have drastically expanded a number of SKUs in the private label program in the last quarter of the year from only 200 to more than 1,000.
 Net debt means that in 2004 especially once we have the new catalog out, which is September there will be a much higher proportion of private label in that catalog, and that will drive private label sales in the second half of 2004 in the element of the product line extension in the U.S. I think we have seen quite good results in the facility and break room category in 2003.

840279_T,1,"{48,49}","I think it’s quite a difficult question to answer Patrick. I believe this largely depends on the adoption rate for the new services. In terms of SMS area, of course we can introduce new SMS products and new automation and a user have multiple subscriptions. So we can market new product to existing users who already have the subscription for our existing product. I think there will be more coming from the new product, new service subscriptions like MMS, like IVR, like WAP service and this area – and it’s too early for us to make a prediction in terms of how strong these new services will grow in the next year or two. These services, although they are showing very strong growth in the current quarter and also with the strong growth in Q1, but they are still off very low base. In terms of financial contribution, it’s very small. So it’s too early for us to predict how big these services will be and we will have to wait for another one or two quarters to have more visibility in this area I guess. As we communicated with you before, currently only a small percentage of the people actually subscribe to these so called value added SMS services considering the total subscriber base in China is roughly 300 million. The reason for that is because the text messaging on a value added basis is not all that exciting. Most folks are simply using text messaging to text one another. So that’s the stage that they’re at and I think as Charles pointed out, as we’re moving out to more fancier products, more complicated products, even more java based products, I think that’s when you're going to see a strong surge in terms of these value added subscriptions. Unfortunately currently some of the services are a little bit new to people and people really haven’t figured out how to use it and also the standards, the infrastructure for some of these products require a 2.5G GPIS and the CDMA platform. Those things, in terms of both building bases as well as ability to connect reliably and there’s still some chinks to be worked out. We believe that both China Mobile and China Intercom are working very diligently on this front and we’re looking forward to seeing improvements over the next few quarters.

840289_T,1,"{30,32}","In terms of deferred revenue? I would look to see it steadying. There is a seasonal pattern to our licensing which is becoming more complicated because we are undergoing a transformation of the mix in that licensing. 
 Let me attack that question by just giving you - everybody on the call an overview. Historically we've had the greatest concentration of our license volume in the second half of the year, with September being the greatest, the fiscal year end; followed by June and then December with the March quarter being the softest. That is being complicated by a shift within that license volume from the iSeries which we generally deferred and amortized over a 12 month period, to the SyteLine which we generally book when we ship it when we sign the contract. 
 Having said all that, I don't expect to see dramatic shifts in the deferred license number going forward. I think the transformation of our mix will occur over this year. We may have seen an aberration this particular quarter, the SyteLine was above iSeries and we could have a couple of deals in the iSeries customers either in the March or June quarter and see it swing back the other way. Longer term as we roll out SyteLine and build pipelines outside of North America, you're probably going to see a transformation where most of our new license activity is on the SyteLines product.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

845229_T,2,"{63,64,65,66}","In considering the market share progression over Path to Growth, Mark, you have got to consider two elements. One we have been harvesting tail brands and that is like having good cholesterol and bad cholesterol. We have been taking the bad cholesterol out as we have been harvesting the brands and we have been growing the good cholesterol as we have increased the market share of the leading brands.
 As we look through the period of Path to Growth, we have seen a small increase in aggregate market share. If you look at the period prior to Path to Growth, what we actually saw was again a gain in market share being offset by share losses as we exited from categories. You will remember that we actually reduced the number of categories from over 50 to 13 at the start of Path to Growth and those too were largely offsetting.
 In looking at the model going forward, we have got the focused brand portfolio, built on strong brands, that gives us the relationship with the retailers and we expect to get the underlying sales growth in the range of 50 to 100 basis points that we have put within the model. We are now really going to close down. We will take your question, but that is it, because we have been here for two and three quarter hours and I am just noticing people beginning to nod off and I don't want to keep you from your sleep longer than I should. One thing that surprises me is that in the plan for 2010 is that you haven't committed to, or suggested significantly higher R&D spending and it is often forgotten, because it is a small part of your cost base, but there is so much that could be achieved in there, for relatively little money in the Group scale, I am surprised you haven't mentioned it. Is that because in practicality a lot of the discoveries that are useful to the Group are made outside the Group and you bring them in, or is it something to do with the funnel of new product development being full and as much as the Group can handle. Well, I think there are a number of things. First of all, we are not a pharma company and just to get the thing in context our level of R&D spend, whilst high for our industry, is still only 2% of our turnover, a little over 2%, and it is a much more focused R&D effort now than it was, because the brand portfolio is much more focused and the amount of categories are really much fewer so we are actually, in my view, getting a lot more and more quickly out of our scientific spend now than we used to and I think we will get some more in the future.
 If we were to increase it by let's say, 50% that would be 1% on our turnover and I don't think that is really in the context of what we have been trying to frame today. It is something that is a level of detail that you would expect us to get into. We will spend on science that which we feel is appropriate to spend to keep us competitive today and to ensure that we are better placed than anybody else to exploit the opportunities which will occur in the future from development in the mapping of the human genome, biotechnology or what have you. You can take it that we are very alert to and very engaged in making sure that gives us real competitive advantages in the future.
 So let me just try and sum up in a couple of words by going back to our plan for valued delivery to the year 2010. How we are going to achieve this, the key building blocks. The key building blocks remain. Sharp brand focus, efficient supply chain and an aligned organization. We will bias our plans towards the long term brand strength, a growing free cash flow and enhancing our return on invested capital.
 Why am I confident that we can achieve our goals? Execution of Path to Growth has been mostly good, largely good, I would say. Our brands are in better shape in aggregate than at any time in our history. Our supply chain has been transformed and our management is ready to go.
 Path to Growth is a journey, not a destination. It has taken us to a position that we could not have dreamed of when we set out. We know we will have work, we have work to do and this is our immediate focus. Executing it will create another major increase in value, but we will only be successful if we are single minded about building brands that last and last and last. Path to Growth has given us that opportunity and provides us with the firm foundations for building the next phase of Unilever's journey.

Our interest expense which was 9.5 but there is a 400,000 amortization of an interest rate edged in there, so it’s actually back out at 9.1 and our maintenance capital was about 1.7 for the quarter.

875994_T,1,{3},"Okay Saffra thanks. Let me just try and go through some of those questions and why don’t I begin with just our estimates of the search opportunity? There’s obviously a lot of numbers out there about what the total market for search is in the neighborhood of billions of dollars. The market that we are serving is being a services provider and marketing agency, so to speak, for clients that want to do search more effectively. Right now that market space is largely comprised of small private companies who are just almost starting to form a very fragmented beginning of an industry and we think that we’re in a very good position to capture the space and establish leadership positions very quickly. 
 The way we think we can differentiate them, Saffra, is in a couple of areas. One is search to date has been largely on the back of small medium businesses that have taken advantage of the online channel. I think the Fortune 1000 clients are just now beginning to realize the huge opportunity they have for using search as a customer acquisition vehicle. I think one differentiator is our experience in working with the Fortune 1000. The problems with the Fortune 1000 are very complex. They are very decentralized. They span numerous countries and numerous regions and that’s an area that we've demonstrated a strong competence in. 
 The other areas deal more with the capabilities of delivering the offering and that deals with strategy, with analytics, with creative, with robust analytical tools. These are all the same capabilities and competencies that we already deliver to our clients in serving their email solutions. So we believe that we have the right access to the Fortune 1000 market place. We have the right service model to serve the Fortune 1000 client and then through what we've done in email, we have the right set of services and tools to then deploy highly differentiated capabilities for the Fortune 1000.

But the increases were at our very short haul utilities. We have two plants here in Kansas City that are essentially just switch moves where we switch the plants with the coal.

876945_T,1,"{3,5,7,9}","Good morning, John. OK, let me try to start at a little different level on that, John. First of all, there are three general reasons that our margins were impacted negatively during the first quarter. First, you have an issue of mix. You know, you always have mix. In our case, we shipped more low-speed gearing than high-speed gearing, we shipped some smaller pumping units mix-wise more than the larger ones. That was a factor. I can't quantify that one. I'll come to the cost-price squeeze last.
 The other thing that's less clear, though, is the impact of ramp-up inefficiencies where we're bringing a lot of people into the organization right now and as you might predict and it's the reason I talked about our capacity's been expanded as we can, you have scrap being generated, you have inefficiency problems that are flowing into the overall margins. So it's not just the steel prices.
 On the steel and other prices, let me - if I can remember all the questions, first of all on a pumping unit, the answer, as usual, depends. If you're talking about a mid-sized-type pumping unit, about 20% of the cost structure would be associated with steel prices, and you're looking at plate, you're looking at I-beam, some sheet. And so each size would have to be analyzed a little differently to see the total impact, but that's the best starting point that I could have on that. Now the surcharge issue, as I indicated, we don't have a practice of surcharges on any products except for our castings, and that is something that historically has been in the Foundry business - I don't know, forever, I suppose. But it's an expected thing, and that is that if the price of scrap iron goes up or the price of scrap steel, then it will be passed on to the customer in the form of a surcharge. And so we participate in that. It does have this lag factor, so that for this first quarter, as in our Foundry operations, we had to absorb those cost increases but we will be passing those on during the second quarter. So in our Foundry operations, we had to not only deal with that aspect but we also had the inefficiencies of bringing on a lot of new people at that at one time. So some of that will be behind us there.
 The bulk of our sales, though, certainly fall outside the Foundry operation, and it's up to us to manage those numbers. We have experienced procurement people, and we've all been tuned into the rapid rise of commodities for some time and we've been talking certainly since the middle of January about the percentage increases being kind of over the top - you know, getting a telephone call every five days from your steel distributor with yet a new number to talk about. So it has been a tough time.
 We do have some modest - I hesitate to call them buy-forward contracts because they are really, but we've committed to some steel in advance that mitigated some of these increases, but that just postpones the day for when you have to replenish that inventory. And so we have already approached our customers to work price increases and unfortunately I think that we're - and we're in the process of approaching some of those customers a second time within a couple months, and as you can imagine, that's not an easy thing to do. And in some cases we have long, established relationships with these customers and we want to maintain them one way or the other.
 We - our view as near as we can tell and I guess no less an authority than ""The Wall Street Journal"" had an article a couple days ago about these commodity prices beginning to level off. I would hope that to be true. Of course, they're leveling off at a pretty high level. And so we are looking at price increases and possibly - possibly the introduction of a surcharge situation - a surcharge type of increase with one or two customers. And that has to do with contractual relationships, et cetera. It's the sort of thing that makes us very, very careful on accepting new orders to make sure that we have commitments covered on procured material. This is true in Trailer. Oilfield is less of a - less of a situation there. But a high percentage of the materials that we use in Trailer are purchased, and so we have to manage that very closely. So we've updated our cost a couple of times in the last three months. So we're aware of the problem and the challenge and working it in all the standard ways that we know.",test,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

I think that when you really drill down what the root cause of the delay that is being generated, it's from the integration of this system at the user end and making it their top priority as it is for us. You know they have some other issues that they are working on with respect to other IF issues or other priorities that just have not risen to the highest level that we deemed it necessary. Another issue, Al, is this -- the Med surge distribution network throughout the United States is one that -- is really evolved, particularly, over the last several years through channel consolidation and a major roll up of sometimes large players acquiring larger -- being acquired by larger players or in a lot of instances many smaller units being acquired by a group to become a large nationwide network and the enormous challenge to them of their own internal systems integration for their own information management capability are their top priorities, then at getting on with better inventory management capability through these kinds of continuous replenishment programs, follows in the order of their priorities in the investments they are making. And when you look at Cardinal -- Cardinal as a wholesaler of pharmaceutical products in Dublin, Ohio has no vendor they likely do business with, that they are not connected in the vendor managed inventory program with as we are speaking.

Oxinium in the U.S. of this stage is used in some 40% of knee femorals, 60% plus of unicompartmental knees, and over 40% of femoral heads. We are planning to introduce a knee revision component made of Oxinium later this year. OK? Yep. Now, in the general tender of the U.S. market, as you know, the key reason why our sales in Endo were down 4% last year, was particularly the growth in blade reuse.

We made it available to patient advocacy groups and for the loss of intense of that boat, into talking to our customers about this.
 Our view is that broadly, we have stabilized the situation that may be a very small decline in the market this year due to reuse, but it will be small.

It took us longer to get fit to be both backward and forward compatible with the existing components, which is a huge strength in our building (ph) after the market.
 We are going to do great reception for it.

In 2004, our revenue growth is driven from retail and this is first of all related with the rise in a commission.

 I would like to make one point of clarification. Earlier Sandy asked about our leverage at our Dobson Communications Systems, including the bond and he gave a 7.2 times multiple.

909729_T,1,"{47,49,51}","The first point to make is, we have an active foreign exchange management program, Mark. Honestly, we focus mostly on economic foreign exchange hedging, as opposed to hedging that is really just driven toward book returns, although in areas where the book impact of foreign exchange could be significant, we have in some instances, immunized ourselves against movements there as well. But our principal focus is on real economics, real building of value to the shareholder. And we have, there are 2 impacts of foreign exchange flowing through the quarter. And I know you understand the way the accounting of foreign exchange works. 
 But we actually have gains, as we indicated in the quarter, in terms of a comparative year-on-year because of the relative strengthening in our revenues, and in our operating expenses in the business lines. But in the reported loss it's, the number really is fairly small. You can expect that number to move in a modest way up and down. I wouldn't expect it to move in a major way, as in fact it has not. And even now, the move from positive to negative is relatively small, and hasn't had a major impact on operating results. Sure, Mark. The best thing to do, would be maybe after the call, look at the page 18 of the supplement, and you can see the premiums earned over the course of the last 7 or 8 quarters and it's been a very, very steady earnings. And that's ultimately the reason we are in the business. Premiums written, as you're aware, depends on the form that we right the transactions in. 
 In the quarter, we actually were up on premiums written versus last year, but some of that is in derivative form, which is down below in the net realized and unrealized. So a combination of 3 or 4 things happened in the quarter. The whole financial guarantee industry did have a slow first part of the year. That has started to recover in the last 60 days of the second quarter. And in particular, in the first half of July we had 20% of our premiums for the year. So how our written premium reflects both the fact that we are a reinsurer, so our reinsurance volume was down, reflecting the industry, but also our actual written premium is increasing steadily or nicely. 
 Operating expenses are up, in line with building out the business. We have basically reached the point now, where we've hired all the senior level people that we need to hire to be a full participant in the industry. We have a few more junior positions to go. And so I think what you are going to see is the earnings that emerge . We've continued to tell people over the past couple of years, that you should expect 2005 as the first year that you truly begin to see the full earnings emergence. 
 A final point, if you look at the statistics that the rest of the financial guarantee industry uses, the so-called adjusted book value figure, which encompasses the embedded value of all the premiums written to date but it's not yet been earned, that figure is just under 1.5 billion for XL right now, versus investment of just north of 500 million in the business. So what will flow through in the future, is upwards of 6 to $700 million of earnings from business that we've already written and is already on our books but will flow through. The 26 million is not included in XL operating earnings. That includes the premium on derivative form which is not included. We want one line item for all our derivative form exposures. The best thing I can say is looking forward 2005 and so on, I think Jerry, Scott, and so on, will look at the way we present. If you recall, this is the first year we are presenting our financials in this form, so we will look and see in the future, after we had at least a year, to a year and a half of experience with the current format. So a quick answer to your question is, look at the embedded value that we have and then, if we look, we look at that embedded value as it earns out in the future, that's probably the best way to say that, yes, the earnings will emerge.",train,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

 When that hotel was purchased by the previous owner, it had 25,000 square feet of meeting space, 400 rooms, and then an office building was part of the complex, and it all looked into an atrium that was shared. The prior owner added 40,000 square feet of meeting space, and it is beautiful meeting space -- it's a huge ballroom with 25-foot ceilings -- and then converted the office space to 250 suites, which are all brand-new. And all that was completed in March of '02. 
 But what they didn't do is they didn't renovate the original 400 rooms, and those friends had been in very, very poor conditions. And I've seen a lot of rooms in my day, and they are very, very tough -- which, of course, is tough to sell to any traveler, but especially groups that comes through. What they all want to know is, can you guarantee that I'm going to get one of these nice, new suite rooms, instead of these older regular rooms? And that's tough to guarantee, when you have groups that come in, especially when they are assigned (ph). So as this renovation is completed -- and all the public areas have been done, and look great -- as this is done, it's a process of usually people won't book with you until they actually see the renovation with their own eyes. So that process is under way as these rooms are being completed and coming online. 
 So we expect the group component of this hotel, which historically had been about 40 percent of the business, to jump up ultimately, hopefully, to around a 60 percent. And in most markets, the transient customer is the highest-rated customer, in about 80 percent of the markets out there. But in a few markets like Orlando, like this market, group is a higher-rated business generally, because you have so much leisure business that comes in, and leisure business is lower-rated. So we expect the leisure component to start to net down and the group component to start to net up. The real big increases in ADR, though, will come not only from the shift from individual leisure travelers to groups who are changing the mix, but also in the types of business that you can get, as well, because you are able to book some of the larger association, national association, maybe, and then corporate group business. But those have a pretty good leadtime on them, of a number of months. Especially the association business can be over a year or even longer. 
 So we expect the increases in average daily rates at this property next year and then in the next, I'd say, probably couple of years after that, as it restabilizes in the market. In my opinion, this is the nicest full-service hotel in the marketplace. I don't know if you guys here disagree with that, but we are very excited about it. And the price per key is just phenomenal -- $125,000 price per room, improved, is just a great spot to be.

 Of course, we can benefit ourselves for this procedure and we have also initiated the win back based on level consent.

 Regarding the ADSL market, first of all we have to recognize that during the months of June, July and August our competitors were not active at all. We have seen that in October, at the end of September and in October they are more active in the market. And this is 1 of the reasons why the market has grown up, as I told you before, in the month of October. 
 What I can tell you is that most of the customers that our competitors are taking are new customers. And they are taking very few of them from us. So, we are not really seeing a significant increase in the churn rate because of that. 
 In addition to that, I think that it is very important that you take into account that our competitors in October made higher dues of wholesale global offer than the URL. So, because of that we are going to have a significant growth in October in our wholesale service.

962444_T,1,"{85,88,89,90,92,93,94,95,96,97,98}","Yes, okay, we have announced and discussed it several times that on the table (ph) side, in the middle of last year, where the market was very weak, we have accepted some very low-margin orders and had agreed at that time with our labor sides that the negative result must be borne by both -- 50 percent on our side and 50 percent on the labor side. We had some constructive discussions, also some constructive results, but of course, the contribution coming from the labor side was a little too low. And that is why we're discussing that again and we hope that we will come to a conclusion there.
 And we also had some structural problems there coming from a situation that, of course, the shipbuilding has moved out from Europe to the Far East. That is a known story. Everybody knows that. And we are reacting to this. But actually, the margins are better, but we think that we can come to a cost-down or a contribution coming from the labor side of something like about 10 million per year -- that is, at least, the target we're actually discussing.
 On the other hand, we have now orders with better margins on hand. We have a very, very heavy load on the workshop that also gives a good contribution. So we think that we have a very good chance next year really to come out with a very reasonable result also on the production-driven four-stroke side of heavy engines. Two quick follow-up questions. Could you update us on your cost-cutting program and what do you expect in terms of return going forward? And the second question is about your dividend policy. Basically, you are quite confident about your ability to improve your profits next year. Could you give us any idea on the payouts you expect for this year and next year? Thanks. The payout and the dividend politics, of course, is something to be discussed with our supervisory board, and we have just started up to discuss it for the running fiscal year, and we also want to define a certain steady policy, and we will come there to a conclusion I think in the meeting we will have in December. And then I think on policy can give a clear answer in which differentiation we are defining our policy.
 And the first question I think was something with the cost-cutting programs. As you know, we are expecting and negotiating this contribution coming from the labor side on one hand. On the other hand, we have a cost-cutting program, and that is we are reducing, if you like so, our work force, and not only on the blue-collar side but also on the white-collar side. We are restructuring our organization, the workflow and our factories. We have given up three factories in our sheet-fed side -- two factories in our sheet-fed side and are concentrating, if you like, those three factories in one. That also gives a dramatic cut on the overhead side. This new setup is working now since the end of September, so that gives some big advantage for the next year.
 We are reducing of course also transport and things like that there, and we are in parallel working very hard, not only on the sheet-fed side but also on the web side, to improve our design and make a technically-driven cost-down on our machines. And we have on several machines where we have a cost-cutting of between 10 to 20 percent, and that requires of course some time, and we have invested also put quite some money in this. But we are very confident that we are successful, as already mentioned.
 We had, on the web side especially, some orders where we had originally calculated with negative margins and finally came out with positive margins. And I mentioned this in connection with the big order for News, where of course also the competition was very tough. But taking account that we are very successful in this cost-cutting program (technical difficulty) technological basis, we are also confident that we will succeed also in this specific case, as we have done and we are doing in all the rest of our activities. Okay, thanks. Good afternoon. Mr. Rupprecht, I wonder if you could comment on market shares a bit. I noticed that your truck market shares pretty much remained static on 2003. Where do you see those going next year, it being the same or do you see some pressures in terms of market share or do you think you can gain? Wonder if you could comment on that please. Yes, we have been rather stable as far as our market share is concerned. We think that until the end of this year we will improve the situation a little because we have to deliver in November and December,. we have to deliver something like about 7500 units, and we think that our market share will improve there, and we will be a little above 15 percent. That is at least the expectation we actually have. If that finally works out or if somebody is also delivering very, very tough at the end of the year, I cannot tell you. But that at least what we are thinking of. And going into next year? Next year. Mr. Samuels has announced several times that he thinks that we have a good chance to increase our market share and he's working very hard on this, and I think they have been very successful until now and we should have very positive impact coming from the (indiscernible) introduction of our new engine type, and therefore I think we also have a good chance really to go in the right direction. I wonder if you could maybe make some similar comments about web-fed and sheet-fed. On the web side, you can see if you look for about three or four years, that the market share depends very, very much of the fact if you get some big orders or you don't get some big orders. But taking into account that we are actually discussing in a final stage this News order and things like that, I am quite sure that on the web side we will have a good chance to come out with something like about 37, 38, 39 percent of market share. And on the sheet-fed side, I hope that despite the fact that we had some two years now that we still have to do some homework, as already mentioned, we should also have something like about 22 percent or something like that.

As you remember, when we were on the roadshow we had talked about having an extension through October and right now we have -- we're working on a 2 week extension at this particular point in time. We are still having very open and good negotiations. They've extended all of the groups that had expired contracts of the same amount. So I know and I have talked with some other group heads that they all received 2 week extensions just as we did. 
 My concern, and I've said this to ABC, was that I don't think we're going to get done in 2 weeks and they said well, we want to keep it to 2 week periods so that there is a clear focus on trying to get to the end of this. So we agreed to that and we are working with them. I really don't think we will have something done next week. I think we will probably be on another extension and the big issue still is the pipe that we talked about, the digital pipe, we've got language going back and forth about what they're going to need and what they'd like to have. We're not going to give them what they'd like to have without without having some idea of how we share in their use of that midstream (ph). That's pretty much the focal point for the other groups as well as far as I know. It's really the digital issue. They'd like to make the stronger programming be more of a better lever point for them. We’ve told them that we are obviously happy with that but we're also coming off of a 4 years in a row of real decline in prime time ratings. So until we start to see -- able to start to recapture some of that share prime time revenue that we've lost, we're not going to be totally happy. But we are happy -- but we're happier than we have been in the past. I think it's also important to note as Ben did earlier in has remarks, that the prime time improvement of ABC are not in segments that give us significant lift in our late night news.

First of all, because they are fully busy right now, and the projects seem to be going well. In terms of our intake, indeed Telemark is on the screen and Thunder Hawke. Telemark, Norsk Hydro -- Telemark is the old Champlain field, which used to be under Chevron Texaco, and we set it up now with Norsk Hydro.
 They were -- there was in the press a few statements that they had difficulties to reconcile their economics. We continue to talk. We were recently in discussions with Norsk Hydro, very advanced discussions. As far as we know, they do intend to make a decision imminently. So it could be a blessing if it would come within the next few weeks. It's pretty much alive.
 On the Thunder Hawke, it's a different subject. It's a semi because it's ultra-deep. Murphy had contemplated several scenarios to develop that. I hope I'm not confused here. Thunder Hawke is Murphy, yes? Yes.
 One alternative was to tie back the reservoir to the Thunder Hawke, because of the incident BP had, it's going to delay the first oil. So the preference of Murphy seems to have switched towards a standalone facility. There was another alternative for a tieback to -- I think it was to the Devil Tower. Don't catch me on this. But there again, we are into advanced discussions, and -- including into commercial and contractual issues.
 So the prospect seems to be a serious one and if it goes it should be a decision during the second half, possibly the coming few weeks. So we are not concerned with Atlantia. First of all, because they are full, so we will need to add capacity and use the synergy within the Houston building to execute, if we get more. And it's a comfortable feeling.
 Second question, I saw you wrote it down. Yes, now which ones were -- on the supply side, yes, maybe we need the slide back, hold on. Is it -- is there a fast? Which one is it, Hans? It's after this or before this? Yes, you've got it. So your question is, what do we see on the short-term that we would have or we should have painted yellow?
 We had positive news on Cepu. Apparently Pertamina and Exxon have reconciled their differences, so that might go ahead indeed in the short term, possibly six months. I'm a bit hesitant because it has been a prospect for the last three or four years. But the need for the FSO is definitely there and, as we have done Yoho FSO for Nigeria, we will certainly run after this one with enthusiasm.
 The CALM/Turret at Belanak, that must be for the coming two months. Actually we are into advanced discussions with Conoco. The deepwater CALM for Akpo is imminent. The LNG terminal for Brass, that's probably a bit longish. LNG will never go fast. I don't think this one will come within the next 12 months; it might slip further. The two CALMs for Pra, Petrobas are imminent. They go along with the FSO that Modec has got on a lease and operate basis.
 These two CALMs will basically handle the output from that FSO, which is $600,000 or $700,000 a day. So it can't be postponed, it's imminent. Devon, I don't know. The two, Telemark and Thunder Hawke, without an 'E', they are -- they should be very short term. FSRU on the Northeast coast, that will take time. Probably a couple of years before it really materializes. The rest -- the top right ones are a question mark.
 We are active, we are bidding, but it is not exactly clear in the clients' minds how fast they want to go. So -- and to this turnkey list you have to add a certain number of the FPSO lists, which are on the other slide, which probably will come on a turnkey basis as well.
 The Normand installer is not anything to do with a lease and operate contract. It is a boat that we will use to sell offshore contracting services, most of the time as part of turnkey or leased projects that we obtain, like you obtain an FSPO on lease when someone has to install it. We like to do it ourselves using that ship. So one way or another, they are offshore contracting activities that should go with a margin that shouldn't be less than 10%.
 That's about all I can say. Typically, to install an offshore facility in deepwater, it should cost between $10m and $20m. We will not charter that boat out unless really the market would go to hell, and we would have difficulties to keep it busy. But we will not time charter it out. Does that answer the question? We will make the return out of a small return on the bareboat, a basic return, which we share with our co-investors, of course. And we will make the returns through the profits that this offshore contracting will generate. It may sound a stupid answer but we trust our business. We believe this boat will be busy for its whole life, like we had the dynamic installer for 20 years, and we have properly amortized and we have generated margins on the projects that she executed.
 So you cannot really invest and anticipate a return. I would expect the return should be well in excess of the cost of capital, but it will be a strategic card in the hand to secure turnkey, offshore, deepwater contracts. That's the main point. Yes? [Indiscernible]. Deliveries, [moorside] and field is conducted -- with connectable turrets. Could you elaborate on the number of engineering hours on such a project?
 And a second question about it. Well, these are Australians. Are there any nasty surprises up till now? It's a rather complex operation. Engineering hours on Enfield. You catch me short here. I would expect that it will be in excess of 90,000 man-hours of engineering. You have a sharper idea than this? No. Let's say he will take around 100. And the second question was? Are you satisfied about -- well, it's nasty clients [inaudible]. No, no. Woodside is not a nasty client. We have had a very nice cooperation. As a matter of fact, this project has been treated on a target price reimbursable basis, with a shared bonus if we manage to save from the budget. So we worked hand-in-hand with Woodside, and the cooperation has been very good.
 On something that complex and that new, it's a scheme which is the best way for both parties to align their objectives and to get synergy, and it worked pretty well. So we will not have a surprise, I can't see any. We will see, of course, at the start up but -- it's complex but it's nothing new, let me put it that way. Nothing new. It's just a bigger and more complex one than Cossack Pioneer. A second question about LNG. I would have hoped that oil companies would go toward quicker action. Is there an upturn power situation at the moment, or is it still rather slow? And bottle -- speaking about bottlenecks, are they technical or are they more or less financial at the moment? Well, I think the bottlenecks are regulatory. To illustrate the situation, the main -- the largest facilities, of course, and the earliest, were planned along the coasts of U.S.A., both west and east. And you may have heard that Chevron had to suspend their Port Pelican project, and that was not regulatory that was for budget reasons. They chose a rather expensive way to go and now they are surprised that it cost so much. So it is slowed down.
 We read in the press the same comment for their terminal in Baja, California, which is south of San Diego in front of the Mexican border. There it is not regulatory, it is technical and budget.
 I think, for the other terminals in the U.S.A., there is still a way to go to obtain the full approval from coastguard and other entities, particularly you can imagine that on the Northeast of the United States it won't go fast. The need is there but they are new projects.
 LNG is something that makes everybody feel a bit worried. So ultra-cautiousness is probably a big factor, both from the user, the investor, and from the regulatory bodies and agencies. What we may see coming quicker is the need for LNG imports in less industrialized countries, such as Pakistan, Chile, and that might go quicker. And we are working on a few of these projects, as I indicated. Speaking about regulatory issues, we do see a lot of hurricanes. Does it have any affect on the Mexican Gulf regulatory issues and how about that? Well, it's -- I don't expect so. As far as the technical side is concerned, we may see the 100-year storm criteria going up, because I heard this hurricane was worse than anything before, so. But we will design accordingly, and the existing installations, I cannot imagine that they are under any major danger. You may have damage, like you saw during the last, Andrew, I think it was.
 By the way, our facilities there, which we have sold, we don't have anything that we own. Facilities we have sold have resisted pretty well. There was no damage except a few gratings and handrails. No, I don't think the regulatory impact will be negative or will hamper the business. You can imagine that if you have floating regas or oil production floating facilities with storage, the de-manning will be reconsidered. We don't want to leave a large cargo just in the hurricane. That might be a change.
 Everybody going home and leave the facility alone is -- I cannot see that happen when you store oil or gas. Someone has to stay on board. Anyway, it's difficult to predict that kind of things. Yes? Your comment on perhaps that in the future you should take more reservoir risk. Can you just tell me what kind of signals you see in the market, that you made that remark? We are discussing such a scheme for Thunder Hawke. We are not there yet but the client likes to see what it would do, if we were to take some risks, and we are analyzing it. I believe that in the future we will see a demand for that. This concept of the hub in the Gulf of Mexico, of which the Independence Hub is one, is an accepted concept. People invest and they sell by a tariff.
 So as I said, we may see this becoming a trend and we may want to play a direct role. We have to see. But we will always do it very carefully. And is it something you would expect to see more at the government-owned companies or the independents, rather than the majors? No, no, this is not government owned. We're talking of opportunities right now in the Gulf of Mexico. We have never really contemplated leasing any TLP or semis at all outside the Gulf of Mexico. The market is pretty much still concentrated there. Yes? How do you still manage your business risk, if you never have reservoir risk, which you cannot assess? When you talk about reservoir risk, it all boils down to how long a period of, let's say, leasing are you going to be contracted for, and how much of the assets can you depreciate through that contract, and how much residual value are you prepared to take. And, of course, the first attempt will be very cautious. Yes, but -- We don't talk about reservoir in terms of quantity of oil. We talk about commitment, firm commitment, robust commitment, from a reputable client that allows us to mitigate the residual value risk. Yes, but the dutiful client has more information about the reservoir risk than you do, and so is putting risk to you. We are going to limit the risk to a certain amount at the end of the charter, that we will still have in our books. So that's the way we see it. Okay, and one more question, if I may. The efforts or new developments that you see more soon coming up than the Northeast coast U.S., are, let's say, Cyprus, Pakistan, Chile. Would those be small capacity efforts? Are you converted to LNG? It's the converted type, yes. Okay. And your new intimacy, if I may say so, with MISC, would that help you obtain LNG tankers for conversion? It is a lively subject. We have -- we are into this partnership with the objective to develop into the LNG business together. And, for instance, on the Cyprus project, we're presenting together to the client. And in the background, of course, is also Petrobas, who is one of the major LNG suppliers worldwide.
 So that partnership should be an efficient one, when it comes to addressing all the links of the supply chain, and the fact that MISC has tankers in large numbers, yes, it will play a role. And whenever the fleet vessels are suitable for the application, certainly we will have first a look at whether they're wiling to -- and free to sell one of their ships to the joint venture, otherwise we will look outside. But yes, it does. One last - would you be willing to tell who would be the client in Cyprus? Let's call it the power authority. Local utility. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much for your interest again, and we're very pleased that you came in such numbers and that you just sit in the office looking at the web, or listening at the web. We hope to see you on the next occasion, which will be, I presume, in -- when is it? March next year. Thank you, gentlemen and ladies.",train,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
